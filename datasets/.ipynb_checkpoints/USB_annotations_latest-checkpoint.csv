48,Cynthia Lamanda#ACIBENCH-D2N119:llama70b-ul2,[doctor] hey betty how are you doing. [patient] i'm doing okay i just been really frustrated because with my asthma and it just seems like i can never catch a break never get better i'm always it seems like i'm always coughing and wheezing. [doctor] i'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms. [patient] i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since. [doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems. [patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department. [doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now. [patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work. [doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or. [patient] yes yes that's the name of it. [doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that. [patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well. [doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help. [patient] it does. [doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs. [patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs. [doctor] okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep. [patient] yeah for the most part. [doctor] okay now have you ever needed to be hospitalized due to your asthma symptoms you mentioned you've had to go to the er. [patient] yeah for only once i can think of when i was young i think like around eight years old i had to be hospitalized but nothing since then. [doctor] okay i do wan na take a little bit of a a deeper dive here into your er and urgent care visits can you tell me a little bit more about those. [patient] yeah i feel like i've had several i do n't remember the exact number but i've had several this past year they almost always have to start me on prednisone. [doctor] okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing. [patient] yeah yeah sometimes they'll just give me like like a like a large dose over five days. [doctor] okay. [patient] and then sometimes they make me take less and less and less so the over like nine or ten days. [doctor] okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay. [patient] yeah. [doctor] and then when was your last exacerbation. [patient] probably about a month ago. [doctor] okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of your cat now i see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things do you have any other type of issues whenever you you go outside any any seasonal allergies or anything like that. [patient] no not really. [doctor] okay so you do n't have any history of seasonal allergies which is good so it looks like here that you put down that you enjoyed hiking so you do n't have any trouble getting out and going hiking and and have you tried the new trails there behind behind the wreck center. [patient] yeah i'm really excited to i mean i have to be careful because i you know with my coughing my wheezing but i'm really i'm looking forward to getting better so i can really start hiking again. [doctor] okay now i really need you to be truthful when you answer these next questions this is important for taking a good history do you smoke any type of cigarette or tobacco product and have you ever smoked or do you smoke marijuana on a regular basis. [patient] no i've never smoked and i do n't vape either or yeah i do n't smoke cigarettes or marijuana. [doctor] okay and then you said you do n't vape so no vaping or e-cigarette use at all. [patient] hmmm hmmm. [doctor] okay and then are you routinely in an area where there is a lot of airborne particular like smoking in bars or around any type of of you know like race tracks or anything like that. [patient] sometimes i go to the bars with some friends and yeah the smoking does irritate me. [doctor] okay. [patient] so i do n't try to go there often. [doctor] okay thank you for sharing that with me so if it's okay with you i'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam.

[patient] no not really. [doctor] okay so you do n't have any history of seasonal allergies which is good so it looks like here that you put down that you enjoyed hiking so you do n't have any trouble getting out and going hiking and and have you tried the new trails there behind behind the wreck center. [patient] yeah i'm really excited to i mean i have to be careful because i you know with my coughing my wheezing but i'm really i'm looking forward to getting better so i can really start hiking again. [doctor] okay now i really need you to be truthful when you answer these next questions this is important for taking a good history do you smoke any type of cigarette or tobacco product and have you ever smoked or do you smoke marijuana on a regular basis. [patient] no i've never smoked and i do n't vape either or yeah i do n't smoke cigarettes or marijuana. [doctor] okay and then you said you do n't vape so no vaping or e-cigarette use at all. [patient] hmmm hmmm. [doctor] okay and then are you routinely in an area where there is a lot of airborne particular like smoking in bars or around any type of of you know like race tracks or anything like that. [patient] sometimes i go to the bars with some friends and yeah the smoking does irritate me. [doctor] okay. [patient] so i do n't try to go there often. [doctor] okay thank you for sharing that with me so if it's okay with you i'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam. [patient] okay,"The patient, Betty, is experiencing frequent asthma symptoms, including coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath.. The symptoms are triggered by colds, cat exposure, and sometimes occur during outdoor activities.. She uses an albuterol inhaler almost daily and occasionally wakes up at night due to difficulty breathing.. She has had numerous urgent care and emergency department visits in the past year, often requiring prednisone.. The patient's last asthma exacerbation was about a month ago.. She enjoys hiking and is eager to start hiking again once her symptoms improve.. Betty does not smoke, vape, or use marijuana..

55,Cynthia Lamanda#ACIBENCH-D2N119:chatgpt-ul2,[doctor] hey betty how are you doing. [patient] i'm doing okay i just been really frustrated because with my asthma and it just seems like i can never catch a break never get better i'm always it seems like i'm always coughing and wheezing. [doctor] i'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms. [patient] i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since. [doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems. [patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department. [doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now. [patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work. [doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or. [patient] yes yes that's the name of it. [doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that. [patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well. [doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help. [patient] it does. [doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs. [patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs. [doctor] okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep. [patient] yeah for the most part. [doctor] okay now have you ever needed to be hospitalized due to your asthma symptoms you mentioned you've had to go to the er. [patient] yeah for only once i can think of when i was young i think like around eight years old i had to be hospitalized but nothing since then. [doctor] okay i do wan na take a little bit of a a deeper dive here into your er and urgent care visits can you tell me a little bit more about those. [patient] yeah i feel like i've had several i do n't remember the exact number but i've had several this past year they almost always have to start me on prednisone. [doctor] okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing. [patient] yeah yeah sometimes they'll just give me like like a like a large dose over five days. [doctor] okay. [patient] and then sometimes they make me take less and less and less so the over like nine or ten days. [doctor] okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay. [patient] yeah. [doctor] and then when was your last exacerbation. [patient] probably about a month ago. [doctor] okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of your cat now i see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things do you have any other type of issues whenever you you go outside any any seasonal allergies or anything like that.

[patient] sure so i've had it for about two months now and it's recently become red and is draining so i was concerned about how it's healed. [doctor] okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden. [patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach. [doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics. [patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet. [doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you. [patient] i do n't recall the name exactly. [doctor] do n't recall alright. [patient] something i had taken it before. [doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it. [patient] i'm sorry. [doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot. [patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance. [doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt. [patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red. [doctor] okay. [patient] i have n't had that before. [doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled.

104,Rachel Usher#XSUM-28345611:falcon7b-ul2,"When you think of a laboratory you wouldn't usually think of cheering crowds or actors in costumes.. You might not associate academic analysis with raucous outdoor performances or atmospheric indoor shows under candlelight.. But Shakespeare's Globe on London's Bankside is a kind of living laboratory, with its own team of in-house scholars, researchers and academic advisers.. Everything from the physical design of the theatre through to the individual performances is informed by the insights and research work of academics. The Globe's site beside the River Thames now has two theatres, with the opening of an indoor Jacobean theatre alongside the existing thatch-roofed, open-air playhouse.. Building this much smaller, enclosed theatre, called the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, was an academic challenge in itself.. Farah Karim-Cooper, one of the Globe's resident scholars, says that it's not a replica of a specific playhouse of the era, but a building assembled from different pieces of architectural evidence and contemporary sources.. The design, a wooden candle-lit chamber, with some of the audience practically on stage, is the result of ""informed, rigorous speculation, based on all the available evidence"".. But this doesn't mean an obsessive interest in re-creating ""authenticity"", says Dr Karim-Cooper. The buildings, like the performances, are about a living, breathing engagement with modern audiences.. ""We're not interested in re-enactment,"" she says.. But she considers the theatre an experiment in seeing how things work in practice. Like how do you move a play from the operatic scale of outdoor theatre to the close-up intimacy of the indoor theatre?. It was something that happened regularly in Shakespeare's day, taking plays from the outdoor Globe to an indoor playhouse such as the Blackfriars, built in the atmospheric ruins of a monastery on the other side of the River Thames.. It must have been like a rock band switching from a festival stage to a nightclub. The Globe was playing in daylight to open-air crowds, while the indoor theatre was a smaller, much wealthier audience, watching close-up in candlelight.. The Globe team researched different types of candles, with beeswax chosen over tallow for the warmth of the light.. And in terms of lighting effects, the indoor theatre has pulley-operated candelabra - or else the actors themselves carry candles.. Light and darkness were almost characters in their own right in plays of this pre-electric era. ""Darkness was a terrifying presence,"" says Dr Karim-Cooper.. ""Darkness was palpable, something that people seemed to be able to touch, it was so thick. It was very much associated with all the horrors of the imagination, the devil, demons, witchcraft -  that dark, dark world they felt was out there."". She says that if Elizabethans or Jacobeans travelled in time to modern London ""their retinas would burn if they saw our levels of light"".. Another big difference is that Shakespeare's audiences would have been in the same lighting level as the actors on stage.. The modern experience of an audience sitting in the dark while the stage is illuminated - a convention carried into the cinema - would have been completely unknown.. In the indoor theatres, audiences were paying high prices to see and be seen. The really big spenders could sit in seats at the side of the stage, where they expected to be as much part of the spectacle as the actors.. And one of the most distinctive features of plays at the reconstructed Globe is that it's impossible not to watch the audience as much as the play.. ""It was a very social occasion,"" says Dr Karim-Cooper, describing the Shakespearean-era theatre as a long day out, with little precise time-keeping and much comment on who was in the crowd and the finery of what they were wearing.. ""Contemporary accounts are more about the audience and who was there and what happened - more than the actual play,"" she says.. Putting the actors and audience in clear view of one another changes how plays would have been performed.. For instance, the great soliloquies in the tragedies become a conversation with the audience, says Dr Karim-Cooper.. Modern audiences, in a darkened auditorium, might expect these classic speeches to be a form of introspective, interior monologue. When the audience and actors are looking into each other's eyes, it becomes a different moment.. There are other big changes between a modern and Shakespearean theatre visit.. It would have smelled very different, says Dr Karim-Cooper. There would have been a heady mix of the perfumes that were highly prized, alongside the earthy scent of thousands of people crammed in together.. Another sensory difference would have been the ""soundscape"", she says. It would have been a much softer sound, as Elizabethan London didn't have engines or loud machinery or amplified music.. ""In terms of how loud things can get, they had no idea,"" she says. ""There are accounts of people being freaked out by the audience clapping in a playhouse, the sound was so overwhelming. They never heard a plane taking off."". The language would have sounded unusual too. The accent of the time would have meant words such as ""move"" and ""love"" would have sounded much closer to rhyming.. And the Globe has been presenting readings of plays with the original pronunciation.. The role of the theatre's research team isn't to be trainspotters in historical accuracy but to provide practical advice for actors and directors.. ""There is nothing worse than an academic who has never been on a stage, saying this is what you should do. It wouldn't work,"" says Dr Karim-Cooper.. Instead they talk to the performers about the plays and can research any detailed questions. They pride themselves on a quick turnaround, going to the original sources and delivering an authoritative report within a few days.. ""We want to get beyond Wikipedia,"" she says..

It was very much associated with all the horrors of the imagination, the devil, demons, witchcraft -  that dark, dark world they felt was out there."". She says that if Elizabethans or Jacobeans travelled in time to modern London ""their retinas would burn if they saw our levels of light"".. Another big difference is that Shakespeare's audiences would have been in the same lighting level as the actors on stage.. The modern experience of an audience sitting in the dark while the stage is illuminated - a convention carried into the cinema - would have been completely unknown.. In the indoor theatres, audiences were paying high prices to see and be seen. The really big spenders could sit in seats at the side of the stage, where they expected to be as much part of the spectacle as the actors.. And one of the most distinctive features of plays at the reconstructed Globe is that it's impossible not to watch the audience as much as the play.. ""It was a very social occasion,"" says Dr Karim-Cooper, describing the Shakespearean-era theatre as a long day out, with little precise time-keeping and much comment on who was in the crowd and the finery of what they were wearing.. ""Contemporary accounts are more about the audience and who was there and what happened - more than the actual play,"" she says.. Putting the actors and audience in clear view of one another changes how plays would have been performed.. For instance, the great soliloquies in the tragedies become a conversation with the audience, says Dr Karim-Cooper.. Modern audiences, in a darkened auditorium, might expect these classic speeches to be a form of introspective, interior monologue. When the audience and actors are looking into each other's eyes, it becomes a different moment.. There are other big changes between a modern and Shakespearean theatre visit.. It would have smelled very different, says Dr Karim-Cooper. There would have been a heady mix of the perfumes that were highly prized, alongside the earthy scent of thousands of people crammed in together.. Another sensory difference would have been the ""soundscape"", she says. It would have been a much softer sound, as Elizabethan London didn't have engines or loud machinery or amplified music.. ""In terms of how loud things can get, they had no idea,"" she says. ""There are accounts of people being freaked out by the audience clapping in a playhouse, the sound was so overwhelming. They never heard a plane taking off."". The language would have sounded unusual too. The accent of the time would have meant words such as ""move"" and ""love"" would have sounded much closer to rhyming.. And the Globe has been presenting readings of plays with the original pronunciation.. The role of the theatre's research team isn't to be trainspotters in historical accuracy but to provide practical advice for actors and directors.. ""There is nothing worse than an academic who has never been on a stage, saying this is what you should do. It wouldn't work,"" says Dr Karim-Cooper.. Instead they talk to the performers about the plays and can research any detailed questions. They pride themselves on a quick turnaround, going to the original sources and delivering an authoritative report within a few days.. ""We want to get beyond Wikipedia,"" she says.. She is co-editor of Moving Shakespeare Indoors, a collection of essays on indoor Jacobean theatres, and education is a key part of the Globe's work.. There is a postgraduate degree course in Shakespeare Studies with King's College, London. There are outreach projects with local schools and training events for teachers.. Every year there is a landmark schools production, the Playing Shakespeare series, with thousands of free tickets for London pupils. It's been a huge success, with many  coming to see Shakespeare plays who have never been inside a theatre before.. Dr Karim-Cooper says they want to extend the idea of the theatre as a laboratory.. ""We want to become a research hub. We want students to be here."". The ""unique blend"" will be the dramatic experimentation alongside the ""literary rigour"".. ""We don't separate the practical from the academic.""","Shakespeare's Globe in London uses its in-house scholars, researchers and academic advisors to ensure everything from physical design to performances is historically accurate, yet engaging for modern audiences.. The Globe has two theatres, including the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, an indoor Jacobean theatre, which was designed based on architectural evidence and historical records.. The theatre seeks to replicate the close, warm atmosphere of performances of Shakespeare's day.. The team note that the ways in which plays were performed would have vastly differed from today’s practice.. Original soliloquies, for instance, would have been a conversation with the audience, highlight the scholars, who are also involved in researching detailed questions raised by the play's actors and directors in order to improve performances.",,gpt4,XSUM

On a night when Wembley paid its respects to the late Dutch legend Johan Cruyff with applause in the 14th minute, a much-changed England side slipped to a rare defeat at the national stadium.. Man-of-the-match Jamie Vardy rounded off a slick passing move to steer in Kyle Walker's cross four minutes before the interval - but Roy Hodgson's side could not protect their lead.. England's defence lived on the edge too often and were eventually punished when a sloppy passage of play led to Danny Rose handling, and Vincent Janssen scored from the spot after 50 minutes.. The big striker was then too strong for substitute Phil Jagielka, although England complained bitterly he had been fouled, before crossing for Luciano Narsingh to score the winner 13 minutes from  time.. Vardy's transition from the heights he has scaled with Leicester City this season to England has been seamless - and he has stepped up a level in the two friendlies against Germany and the Netherlands.. The 29-year-old has been portrayed as both an ideal starter and the perfect impact substitute as Hodgson makes plans for Euro 2016.. Vardy has proved his capabilities for both, with an explosive 20-minute cameo in Berlin that included a brilliantly instinctive finish as part of England's comeback.. And here, he was England's outstanding performer by some distance, showing the pace and energy that has panicked Premier League defences and also skill to round off that passing move with a clinical finish before testing Dutch keeper Jeroen Zoet with a powerful rising drive.. The debate about how best to use Vardy may go on but one thing is beyond dispute - he is going to Euro 2016 and has the ability to threaten every defence in France.. In an ideal world, Everton's John Stones would have come in at Wembley to produce the sort of elegant display that became his trademark in the early seasons of his career, thus cementing his place alongside Chris Smalling for England's first Euro 2016 game against Russia in Marseille.. Instead, Wembley witnessed a 21-year-old whose confidence has been hit by a recent dip in form at club level and will need a little renovating before the serious action gets under way.. Stones twice brought murmurs of concern from England's fans inside Wembley with his tendency to perhaps over-play out of defence, but his determination to be constructive also started the passing move that led to Vardy's goal.. The young defender is a work in progress and there will be slips - quite literally when he stumbled at the start of a chain of events that led to England keeper Fraser Forster having to save well from Janssen before Rose handled to leave the striker to score from the spot.. Stones is well worth persevering with - but Hodgson must hope some of that confidence and composure returns quickly.. Hodgson warned they must not get carried away after victory in Germany - and, in case anyone ignored the warning, along comes a defeat against a Dutch team that will not even be in France this summer.. In some respects this defeat, albeit with a much-changed side, simply reinforced some of the lessons that came out of the win in Germany that was the catalyst for such a surge of optimism.. England have some very exciting options up front in the shape of Vardy and Harry Kane, while Daniel Sturridge also got a decent 57 minutes under his belt..

The pain originated from a fall up the stairs five months ago.. Weightlifting activities exacerbate the pain, leading him to reduce his gym visits.. While icing the affected areas and avoiding exercise provide some relief, the pain remains significant.. The doctor suspects impingement syndrome in the left shoulder, potentially causing the wrist pain.. Two treatment options are presented: physical therapy (initial preference) and cortisone injection if therapy fails.. The doctor recommends icing, rest, and scheduling a physical therapy appointment soon..

[doctor] so can you tell me about that how are you doing. [patient] well i've been doing okay but i've had this wound on my right foot for a couple of weeks and it's not getting better i saw my pcp and they referred me to you i i used to see a podiatrist and a couple of years ago but they moved and i was n't able to get another one. [doctor] okay and how long have you had the wound. [patient] about two to three weeks. [doctor] okay have you had any kind of trauma to that foot. [patient] no i bought a new pair of shoes to travel with and the neuropathy i guess i did n't feel that they were too tight at first it was just a blister but it looked a lot worse now i've been putting a band-aid on it and. [doctor] okay and so did your doctor put you on any antibiotics when they they saw your foot. [patient] yes i finished the course yesterday the wound looked about the same though. [doctor] okay now does it hurt. [patient] no i ca n't feel it. [doctor] okay now have you had any other symptoms like fever chills drainage from the wound or anything along those lines. [patient] no but when i take my sock off sometimes it sticks to the wound even when i put a band-aid on. [doctor] okay well are you still wearing those same shoes that cause the problem. [patient] no i'm upset. [doctor] i'm so upset too i love those shoes. [patient] no i'm so upset i i love those shoes. [doctor] okay so what kind of shoes are they. [patient] they're hoka's. [doctor] ah so where did you get them. [patient] i got them at rei couple of years ago. [doctor] they're pretty good about helping you to fit your fit you in a shoe are n't they. [patient] yeah.

[doctor] that's good so you've had some issues with stability sometimes or. [patient] yes. [doctor] okay okay well another question i want to ask you is how is your diabetes doing. [patient] i do n't think it's too bad my last hgb a1c was a little over eight. [doctor] okay alright well let me just do a quick physical exam okay for vital signs your temperature is ninety eight . one your vital signs look good your heart rate is seventy two respirations sixteen blood pressure is one ten over sixty five okay so on your foot exam let's see there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot it is just proximal to the right fifth to the fifth mtp joint and there is some yellow slough present with minimal granulation tissue there's no surrounding erythema or cellulitis and there's no evidence of fluid collection there's no necrosis there is no odor i do not appreciate any bony exposure on on vascular exam there are palpable bilateral femoral and popliteal pulses there are no palpable dp or pt pulses but doppler signs are present okay so does this hurt when i touch it here. [patient] no it's okay.

Fawzi al-Odah, 37, was released after a US review panel concluded he was not a ""continuing significant threat"".. He had been at the US facility in Cuba since 2002 after his arrest in Pakistan on suspicion of links to al-Qaeda and the Taliban - a charge he denies.. He had challenged America's right to detain him in the US Supreme Court.. Mr Odah boarded a Kuwaiti government plane on Wednesday morning US time.. ""There's no bitterness, there's no anger,"" his lawyer Eric Lewis was quoted as saying by the Associated Press news agency.. ""There's just excitement and joy that he will be going home."". The release came after Guantanamo's Periodic Review Board in July determined ""that continued law of war detention of (Mr Odah) does not remain necessary to protect against a continuing significant threat to the security of the United States"".. But he now faces at least a year at a militant rehabilitation centre in Kuwait, according to the terms of the release.. The Kuwaiti government had pushed hard for the release of all Kuwaiti detainees at Guantanamo.. Mr Odah had argued that he travelled to Afghanistan and Pakistan to teach the Koran and provide humanitarian aid.. He is the first inmate to be freed since May, when five Taliban detainees were exchanged for US Sgt Bowe Bergdahl, who had been kept by the insurgents in Afghanistan.. Mr Odah's release brings down the total number of inmates at the US naval base to 148.. The US opened the facility in January 2002, following the 11 September 2001 attacks in America.. President Barack Obama has repeatedly promised to shut it down.","Fawzi al-Odah, a Kuwaiti man and one of the longest-held detainees at Guantanamo Bay, has been released and sent back to Kuwait..

She explained that the pain started after a possible mishap in her gymnastics class.. She had tried managing the pain with Tylenol for some days but did not find success.. After examining Mrs. Anderson's shoulder and reviewing her x-ray, the doctor found no broken bone or fracture.. Instead, it was speculated that Mrs. Anderson had hurt her joint.. He suggested she use a pain reliever, specifically 600 milligram of ibuprofen three times a day for a week..

Jerry, a 45-year-old male, came to the doctor with an ankle injury.. He explained that he injured his ankle while playing basketball with his son, Sean.. Jerry mentioned that his ankle is bruised and swollen, causing him difficulty walking and instability.. He also expressed concern about disrupting his workout routine.. The doctor examined Jerry's ankle and determined that he has a displaced lateral malleolus fracture, which requires surgery.. The doctor informed Jerry that he would be out for about three months but can still continue coaching basketball.. The doctor prescribed medication to reduce swelling and advised Jerry to elevate his ankle.",,chatgpt,ACIBENCH

The author had a question about when their account would be charged for the preorder, a query that was mistakenly interpreted by the customer support as a request to cancel the order.. Despite immediately contacting Target to correct the misunderstanding, customer support was unable to reinstate the preorder.. Instead, they offered the author a $25 card as compensation, which did not appease their frustration and disappointment at the mistaken cancellation of their highly-anticipated order.",,gpt4,REDDIT
198,Cynthia Lamanda#ACIBENCH-D2N107:llama70b-ul2,[doctor] so bryan it's nice to see you again in the office today what's going on. [patient] i was in my yard yesterday and i was raking leaves and i felt fine and then when i got into my house about two hours later my back started tightening up and i started getting pins and needles in my right foot. [doctor] alright have you ever had this type of back pain before. [patient] i had it once about three years ago but it went away after a day. [doctor] okay and did you try anything for the pain yet did you take anything or have you have you tried icing. [patient] put some ice on it and i tried two advils and it did n't help. [doctor] okay does it get better when you're laying down sitting standing. [patient] yeah i think the only thing that helped was a hot shower and it feels a little better when i sit. [doctor] okay alright so you said you were raking leaves and now it's been kind of that weather outside for cleaning out the yard have you been doing a lot of yard work lately. [patient] i i i normally do n't do any physical activity. [doctor] yeah i hear you i make a i make my husband do all the yard work too so alright let me take a look at that low back if if you bend over does that hurt. [patient] it hurts a little bit when i bend over yes. [doctor] okay how about when you stand back up. [patient] no pain. [doctor] okay so no pain on extension some pain on flexion how about when i push right here on your back. [patient] yeah that hurts. [doctor] okay so some pain to palpation right around the l5 can i have that. [patient] what happens when family members chime in like i'm doing right now because i actually think it was it hurts more when he stands up because i've watched him bend over but it's when he stands up that it really hurts. [doctor] okay and and what's your relationship. [patient] partners. [doctor] okay so your partner is here with you today and reports that he is also having pain when you are standing up. [patient] i've spent so many times you know who i am. [doctor] so that's right you always come in together have you noticed anything else partner when when he is. [patient] i'm worried about it because he is you know his pain tolerance is so high and he would n't be saying anything if it really was n't a problem because it's not at all like last week when he thought about raking leaves but did n't actually rake leaves but then his back did n't hurt as much but this time it really hurts. [doctor] okay so you think this is more of a long term injury. [patient] no he was just thinking about it hurting when he thought about raking but it did n't. [doctor] okay alright and have you noticed any any prior pain with with the back. [patient] i do n't want to take this away you better go back to talking to him. [doctor] that's alright let's see how it turns out okay so how about if you if i push down on both your feet like this can you push back up on my hands. [patient] can you repeat that. [doctor] if i'm pushing down on your feet can you push push your feet back. [patient] i. [doctor] alright so your dorsiflexion is normal looks like pulses are equal in all extremities you said you had a little bit of a tingling sensation in which leg. [patient] that would be my right leg. [doctor] okay so some tingling in your right leg alright so i know that you had an x-ray when you came in because we always do x-rays when we have our patients come in of your low back and everything looks normal from that perspective so for your back pain sounds like you probably sprained your low back so i what i want you to do is let's rest it i'm going to prescribe some meloxicam have you taken that before. [patient] i have not taken meloxicam. [doctor] alright so i'll prescribe that i'm also gon na prescribe some physical therapy i know you said you have n't been overly active and your partner reported the same thing for a long time so we might wan na get you into some pt and hopefully get you back back in shape get you some stretches that you can do and some exercises and then you know if it's not improving i want you to send me a message and we can possibly look into see if there is anything else going on potentially an mri if it's still not improving does that sound like an okay plan. [patient] it sounds reasonable. [doctor] alright. [patient] i think he should have an mri now i think he had surgery yesterday i think he should have an mri now this it's been hurting for like six hours now and she had an mri we are really worried about it. [doctor] alright you know let's give it a couple of weeks and let's give it two weeks and then call me back and we'll get you an mri if it's still not improving. [patient] good answer. [doctor] alright alright hope you feel better,"A patient visited a doctor for back pain that started after raking leaves.. The patient had a history of back pain that went away on its own.. The doctor examined the patient and found limited flexion and extension, pain with palpation, and normal reflexes.. The doctor diagnosed a sprained low back and prescribed meloxicam and physical therapy.. The patient's partner reported that the patient's pain worsens when standing up.. The doctor suggested waiting two weeks and then getting an MRI if the pain persists.",reflexes,llama70b,ACIBENCH

[patient] a little bit i you know i i hurt that same shoulder because it's my my dominant hand my right hand i hurt it playing baseball when i was younger. [doctor] mm-hmm. [patient] so i've always had a little bit issues but this is it's does n't feel like it's in the rotator cuff it's it's kinda more on the outside and it's kinda like it's more tender on the outside when i raise my arm up so. [doctor] okay yeah are you able to move your arm very well or not. [patient] yeah there is no restriction with my arm it just i definitely feel some pain on the outside of it. [doctor] okay and are you having pain all the time or just or does it come and go. [patient] just whenever i move it if i'm sitting still i really do n't notice anything but whenever i move it then i can definitely feel some pain. [doctor] okay how about at night is it bothering you at night also. [patient] a little bit because i sleep on that side so. [doctor] okay. [patient] of course. [doctor] okay and i may miss did you say what have you been taking for pain for that. [patient] i just been taking some advil and then icing as much as i can so that's about it. [doctor] okay and does that seem to help or. [patient] a little bit yeah a little bit i mean it's it's still like you know sore to touch but it definitely dulls it a little bit. [doctor] well sounds like you have quite a few projects going on what all what all are you doing for for your yard and. [patient] i well let's see i've been putting an outdoor shower in we're extending our patio putting making some flower boxes putting down some you know for stone and all the flower beds so my wife's really put me to work i got a laundry lift. [doctor] wow it sounds like a variety of projects but if you're putting down stone you're probably lifting those as well and then. [patient] yeah. [doctor] yeah i bet that is sore now tell me this have you experienced any numbness in your arm or your hands or. [patient] no not really no numbness that i can think of. [doctor] okay alright so see i'm gon na i'd like to do just a quick physical exam and i've reviewed your vitals those look good your no fever so that's good you're ninety seven . eight and your heart rate looks good at sixty two respirations sixteen your blood pressures one sixteen over eighty four that looks fine your oxygen saturation is real good at ninety nine percent so that all looks good so let's take a look at your left at your right shoulder so you have limited active and passive range of motion and there is some tenderness at the great tuberosity of the humerus there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro acromioclavicular joints you do have a good hand grip okay and on neurovascular exam of your right arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation to touch is intact so i've reviewed the results of your shoulder x-ray and there is no fracture so that's good so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your first problem the left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to this rotator cuff rotator cuff tendinopathy that means you that you injured injured the tendons of the muscles that help make your shoulder muscles i think we had to go ahead and order just an mri since you have had some problems before as well to make sure there's nothing else going on with it and i also want to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so during that time continue the tylenol and if your symptoms do n't improve we can go ahead and consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which could provide some relief do you have any questions about your plan.

[doctor] yeah so if you do n't feel that you did anything to injure it we might start just maybe do some epsom salts have you tried soaking your feet in epsom salts that will tend to kinda pull out what's going on in there and just help your those muscles to relax and the soreness to to go away you might try that.

He has tried physical therapy, pain medication, and considered surgery.. The doctor performed a physical exam, reviewed his MRI results, and diagnosed him with an L4-L5 herniated disk with radiculopathy.. The doctor suggested a spinal injection with a corticosteroid to reduce inflammation and relieve pain.. The procedure is relatively quick and requires monitoring to determine the appropriate intervals between injections, with a maximum of four injections per year..

A World Anti-Doping Agency commission report has accused Russia of running a ""state-sponsored"" doping programme..

""I suspect there are probably four, five or six nations that athletics has a problem with."". Commission chairman Dick Pound said Russia's athletics federation, Araf, should be banned from the Rio 2016 Olympics.. Warner told BBC Radio 5 live: ""Every other international sport today should be looking at Russian sport and looking at whether the men and women who compete in their events are clean."". ""They do not have robust anti-doping regimes. They are asleep on the job - and they have to be rooted out."". Wada's independent commission, which examined allegations of doping, cover-ups and extortion in Russian athletics, also implicated the International Association of Athletics' Federations.. The IAAF's former president Lamine Diack has been provisionally suspended by the International Olympic Committee, who have also asked the IAAF to start disciplinary action against the athletes named in the report.. Araf has been told to respond to the report by Friday and Russia have defended their position..

The 323-page report said that ""acceptance of cheating at all levels is widespread"" in Russia and suggested that neither Araf, Rusada, nor the Russian Federation can be considered anti-doping code-compliant.. The report also said the London 2012 Olympics were ""sabotaged"" by ""widespread inaction"" against athletes with suspicious doping profiles; accuses Moscow laboratory director Grigory Rodchenko of asking for and accepting bribes and intentionally destroying samples he was told to keep; and recommends that five Russian athletes and five coaches should be given lifetime doping bans.. Media playback is not supported on this device. Pound, who chaired the Wada investigation, said the situation was ""worse than we thought"", adding that ""it may be a residue of the old Soviet Union system"".. Warner backed the recommendation to suspend Russia from competition ""until they put their house in order"", adding: ""If you punish one or two innocent Russian athletes for the greater good of the sport, that is a moral dilemma I am willing to grasp."". He also suggested that Russia is unlikely to be the only country guilty of doping, saying that ""athletics has probably got some other nations to root out"".. He added that while ""there are undoubtedly drugs cheats in many corners of athletics"", he believed systemic doping did not occur in nations in the Western world..

The author also notes the customer would have received their parts sooner if the author had just entered a new order instead of adjusting the in-transit order..

[patient] no i'm not a baseball fan but i love spring and chicken time of year launds of outdoor activities nice nice i'm i'm not really a baseball fan either but my husband makes me watch the the meds all the time and they lose all the time so he is always upset so so anyway. [doctor] yeah right so how about your high blood pressure how are you doing with that are you taking your blood pressure medication like i asked. [patient] i'm taking it everyday and i check my blood pressure at home and it's been about one twenty five over eighty most of the days. [doctor] nice okay so i believe we have you on lisinopril about twenty milligrams a day any side effects from that that you're noticing. [patient] not that i know of it's been a good medicine for me and i do n't have any trouble with it. [doctor] okay great alright and since you had this knee pain any numbing or tingling in your foot at all. [patient] no just the swelling and the pain. [doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain. [patient] i i took some aleve twice a day some over the counter aleve twice a day. [doctor] okay and. [patient] putting a cold pack on it. [doctor] okay and has that helped at all. [patient] yeah that's helped a fair amount it's still pretty sore though. [doctor] okay alright well let's see have you ever had any surgeries before let me just think any surgeries i do n't see any in your in your record here. [patient] i had my tonsils out. [doctor] okay you had your tonsils out okay alright well let me go ahead i wan na do a just a quick physical exam i'm gon na go ahead and be calling out some of my clinical exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your vital signs here in the office it does look like you're doing a really good job managing your blood pressure your blood pressure is up is about one twenty over seventy seven today here in the office and that's with you probably in a little bit of pain so that's good and on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some ecchymosis some edema there is an effusion present does it hurt when i press. [patient] yeah that's sore. [doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right medial knee there is i'm just gon na bend your knee in all sorts of directions here does that hurt. [patient] yeah do n't do that anymore. [doctor] alright the patient has decreased range of motion there is a negative varus and valgus test there is a negative lachman sign there is a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is otherwise no lower extremity edema so what does that what does that mean kenneth so that so that means that you essentially i agree with you you had quite quite an injury to your knee and you do have a little bit of fluid in your knee there and just some inflammation which i think we need to talk about okay so i wan na go ahead and just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so for your first problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have what we call a a medial collateral ligament strain you know i wan na go ahead and just order an x-ray of your right knee just to make sure that we're not missing any broken bones which i do n't think we are but what's good about this particular injury is that people typically heal quite well from this and they typically do n't need surgery we can just go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to to strengthen those muscles around your knee so that you do n't have another injury and i wan na go ahead and just prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and that will help take down the swelling and help with some of the pain and you only have to take it once a day and it wo n't really cause any upset stomach or anything like that do you have any questions about that. [patient] yeah if i start that medicine today am i going to be able to ski tomorrow because we got a a big weekend plan. [doctor] i would say i would like you to rest your knee i i think that my concern is that if you go skiing again and you fall that you might injure your knee even more so i think you'll recover from this injury right now but i do n't want you to injure it anymore so i would rest it for a little while at least until we have the results of the x-ray and that type of thing okay for your second problem of your hypertension i wan na just go ahead and continue on lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na just go ahead and order an a lipid panel just to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and then i'm just looking through your health record and it looks like you're due for a tetanus shot so we'll go ahead and just give you a a tetanus shot for a from a health maintenance perspective any other questions. [patient] i think so sounds like a good plan to me. [doctor] okay sounds good alright so i'll see you later we'll get those ordered and i'll be in touch okay take care bye. [patient] thank you,Patient kenneth is an avid water skier who injured his knee while skiing.. He has been using Aleve to reduce the pain..

[doctor] okay well first of all i i agree with you the weather has kinda been all over the place been hot and been cold and and and now it seems like we've had a week of pretty chilly weather hopefully that changes pretty soon so tell me a little bit about when when your back pain started and and and what happened there. [patient] well you wan na hear the long story or kind of the short story because my back has been bothering me for a long time. [doctor] so let's do let's do the reader's digestive version. [patient] well i ca n't i ca n't really tie my shoes you know standing really makes it bad you know when i go to the mall it really really i do n't know all i i've just been bedridden. [doctor] okay and i know it got real bad about a month ago that's what the report here from the pcp said but can you tell me exactly where the pain is in your lower back can you kinda point to where that's at. [patient] yeah it's right here and you know like thirty years ago when i fell off the roof it was really really bothersome they they said maybe there was a fracture or something and you know i do n't know i just could n't play football and then i had to you know kinda try to take care of myself but you know it's it's been really bad for about a month. [doctor] okay and then do you still have that pain that radiates down your left leg sometimes. [patient] yeah of course yeah it goes all the way through here. [doctor] okay and then so it looks like you pointed to your lower back area and then pointed down through your hip and down into your to your left leg can you describe that pain for me. [patient] it's like a electrical tooth ache and it it it goes down the whole leg. [doctor] okay and can you rate that pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in in your life. [patient] right now it's less bad i did n't take my medications because i wanted you to see me as as i am but it's six out of ten but when it gets really bad i'd say it's thirteen out of ten. [doctor] okay and anything that you do make it feel better you mentioned that you know sometimes sitting or laying down anything there make that better. [patient] yeah like i said it the only thing that seems to make it better is laying down. [doctor] okay. [patient] you know standing walking seems to make it worse coughing sneezing makes it worse and you know i had a friend that saw you and you know you burned some nerves or something like that and so i was just seeing if there was something that you could do to get me out of this pain and hopefully you can do it today. [doctor] okay and then any numbness or tingling in in your lower extremities or any weakness there in your legs. [patient] you know it it's my back that's weak and my legs are weak both of them you know coughing sneezing seem to make it worse so sorry i'm just trying to be like a typical patient because most patients they do n't answer the darn questions so you you know all this time i still have n't gotten a chief complaint out of them so i love the way that you're trying to redirect and so you know what your doctor said you had back pain and leg pain but for me the most important thing for me to capture is that it's in the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe and so i need them to be able to give me a perfect sort of root signature so i can hone in is that four five disk seen on the mri really significant or is it on the opposite side but again i'm sorry i'm purposely trying to be in a difficult patient because some of these patients he asked them fifty different questions they wo n't answer any of them so anyway sorry about well. [doctor] that's okay. [patient] to explain but this is what i deal with every single day. [doctor] absolutely. [patient] lot of pain yeah you know what my pain is eight out of ten it goes in the back goes into the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe my foot kinda drags when i walk i've been having to use a cane nothing seems to make it better and but very few patients will give you the perfect history and most people will start talking about you know when something happened or go back to thirty years ago and you wan na redirect them to their current symptom but the patients wo n't rarely ever tell you what the chief complaint is you you got ta pull it out of them. [doctor] so let's take a a quick look at you here okay let's do a physical exam real quick so your vitals look good which is a good thing now on your back exam i do n't see any bony abnormalities no redness or no and no bruising present now do you have pain when i press here. [patient] no it's right here. [doctor] okay so positive for pain to palpation at the l4 vertebrae and if you bend forward do you have pain there. [patient] it hurts all the time especially sitting in these run office desks. [doctor] okay so you are positive for pain with flexion and extension of your back i'm going to go ahead and test the strength of your legs now push out against my hands for me please. [patient] okay that's it that's all i got. [doctor] alright so four out of five strength in the left and five out of five on the right does look like that reflexes are brisk and motor and sensory is intact in both lower extremities i do wan na review the results of your mri the mri shows a disk herniation at the level of l4 l5 vertebrae and it is associated with some nerve root impingement and what that means is the nerve is being compressed by that herniation so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for the diagnosis of of acute disk herniation at l4 l5 with that nerve root impingement that's causing that pain down your leg and your lower back pain now i know you've tried nsaids in the past without relief and you've done some pt so what i'm going to do is i'm gon na recommend an epidural steroid injection and we're gon na do that today for you if you agree to it what that means is gon na place some anti-inflammatory medication right at the spot of inflammation and once that's in place i wan na refer you back to pt and we wan na strengthen that area mkay you're young and otherwise healthy i think you'll do well but it can take about two to three weeks for that injection really to take full effect so then i want you to see pt and i want you to see me again in about a month are you okay with that treatment plan. [patient] sure sounds good. [doctor] alright sounds good i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you prepped and then we'll get that injection for you,"The document discusses a patient's back pain and the physician's assessment of the patient's symptoms and medical history.. The patient has been experiencing back pain for a while and has had difficulty with activities such as standing, walking, and going to the mall.. The physician asks the patient to point to the location of their pain and describes the pain as an electrical toothache that goes down the entire leg.. The patient rates the pain as six out of ten but states that when it gets severe, it can be thirteen out of ten.. The physician performs a physical exam and confirms the patient's pain with palpation and flexion/extension of the back.",,mistral7b,ACIBENCH

[patient] you know it it's my back that's weak and my legs are weak both of them you know coughing sneezing seem to make it worse so sorry i'm just trying to be like a typical patient because most patients they do n't answer the darn questions so you you know all this time i still have n't gotten a chief complaint out of them so i love the way that you're trying to redirect and so you know what your doctor said you had back pain and leg pain but for me the most important thing for me to capture is that it's in the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe and so i need them to be able to give me a perfect sort of root signature so i can hone in is that four five disk seen on the mri really significant or is it on the opposite side but again i'm sorry i'm purposely trying to be in a difficult patient because some of these patients he asked them fifty different questions they wo n't answer any of them so anyway sorry about well. [doctor] that's okay. [patient] to explain but this is what i deal with every single day. [doctor] absolutely. [patient] lot of pain yeah you know what my pain is eight out of ten it goes in the back goes into the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe my foot kinda drags when i walk i've been having to use a cane nothing seems to make it better and but very few patients will give you the perfect history and most people will start talking about you know when something happened or go back to thirty years ago and you wan na redirect them to their current symptom but the patients wo n't rarely ever tell you what the chief complaint is you you got ta pull it out of them. [doctor] so let's take a a quick look at you here okay let's do a physical exam real quick so your vitals look good which is a good thing now on your back exam i do n't see any bony abnormalities no redness or no and no bruising present now do you have pain when i press here. [patient] no it's right here. [doctor] okay so positive for pain to palpation at the l4 vertebrae and if you bend forward do you have pain there. [patient] it hurts all the time especially sitting in these run office desks. [doctor] okay so you are positive for pain with flexion and extension of your back i'm going to go ahead and test the strength of your legs now push out against my hands for me please. [patient] okay that's it that's all i got. [doctor] alright so four out of five strength in the left and five out of five on the right does look like that reflexes are brisk and motor and sensory is intact in both lower extremities i do wan na review the results of your mri the mri shows a disk herniation at the level of l4 l5 vertebrae and it is associated with some nerve root impingement and what that means is the nerve is being compressed by that herniation so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for the diagnosis of of acute disk herniation at l4 l5 with that nerve root impingement that's causing that pain down your leg and your lower back pain now i know you've tried nsaids in the past without relief and you've done some pt so what i'm going to do is i'm gon na recommend an epidural steroid injection and we're gon na do that today for you if you agree to it what that means is gon na place some anti-inflammatory medication right at the spot of inflammation and once that's in place i wan na refer you back to pt and we wan na strengthen that area mkay you're young and otherwise healthy i think you'll do well but it can take about two to three weeks for that injection really to take full effect so then i want you to see pt and i want you to see me again in about a month are you okay with that treatment plan. [patient] sure sounds good. [doctor] alright sounds good i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you prepped and then we'll get that injection for you,"Matthew has been experiencing back pain for a long time, with the pain recently worsening.. The pain radiates down his left leg and is described as an electrical toothache.. He also experiences weakness in his back and legs, and coughing or sneezing worsens the pain.. A physical exam revealed pain upon palpation at the L4 vertebrae, pain with flexion and extension of the back, and reduced strength in the left leg..

""perfect"", i think to myself - my phone is waterproof up to 1.5 meters for up to 30 minutes.. so in my daughter goes, with me in tow with my shiny new z3 compact.. now before i went in, i double, triple, quadruple checked that all the seals in my phone were closed.. hell, if i bought all those magnetic chargers i sure as hell wasn't going to leave a gate open for water to get in.. the phone worked great, i took some pictures and felt like a hero as everyone marveled at my waterproof phone.. not that i was in that deep mind you, less than a meter since my daughter couldn't swim and needed the support of my wife and i.. mere minutes pass and i feel immense heat coming from my phone, i check it and the screen is black and unresponsive.. i exit the pool feeling discombobulated, wonder what was wrong with my phone.. i dry the device off and give it a close inspection, mist was building up in the camera lenses, i open the gates and droplets of water begin to  fall out... shit.. i'm red faced but that's alright, it's a mass-manufactured device, sometimes these things happen, i'm sure sony will take care of it.. so i gave sony a call and arrange for the device to be sent back to an authorised repairer in australia.. it's christmas so it will take a few days and luckily i still had my old iphone 5 handy.. three weeks later i receive the phone back in the mail with a note saying that it had passed the pressure tests and warranty won't be honoured by sony.. i call sony to discuss how this is possible since the gates were closed and water had obviously entered the device, sony will no longer cover the device and have nothing further to comment since it supposedly passed the pressure tests.. i have no avenue to appeal or request a second opinion.. i fucked up by touting how good the product was and have been left high and dry by the company whose products i was spruiking.. during the period that my phone has been out of action, i've missed the opportunity to capture key moments such as my daughter's first steps.. now even if i bought another device, i would be afraid to put it near water in the event that it gets waterlogged and pressure testing indicates otherwise.. **","** The writer is an iPhone user who was disappointed by the specs of the latest iPhone, so they purchased a Sony Xperia Z3 Compact instead..

401,Rachel Usher#XSUM-34007864:llama70b-ul2,"The results have been published for more than five million GCSE entries - which will be five million different stories of exam dreams, dramas and disasters.. But the overall national picture for GCSE grades is very similar to last year. The proportion getting A* to C grades has nudged up from 68.8% to 69%.. That represents an improvement for more than 10,000 exam entries. But the overall message - and the even smaller decline in the proportion of top A* and A grades - is that there is ""stability"".. This isn't an accident. The annual exam results are not like going outside and measuring the temperature as a natural phenomenon which might fluctuate.. It's more like setting the central heating to an agreed level and then holding up a thermometer to see if the temperature is where it should be.. Well, perhaps that's not a complete analogy, but the national exam statistics, with their neat similarity to last year, are a work of design rather than nature.. The huge annual challenge for the exam system is to balance a number of competing demands. There has to be room for some slight ups and downs, but there mustn't be grade inflation, standards have to be maintained over time and - at the very heart of the process - it has to be a fair reward for the hard work of individual pupils.. Add to this complex equation the need to adjust grades between different exam boards.. Head teachers' leader Brian Lightman has complained that below the smooth surface of the national statistics, there can be doubts about the reliability of individual results.. He has warned of ""volatility"", with heads unable to explain sudden dips and spikes, problems that remain unnoticed from a national perspective.. ""It is devastating for a student who has been on course for a certain grade to miss what they were expected to achieve and it is mystifying to their teachers,"" said Mr Lightman.. The lingering question is if one year's results are reverse engineered to be very similar to the year before, does this mean distorting some of the results to make sure that they fit? Are there winners and losers in some subjects and at some grades?. Ofqual has always argued that fairness for individual students is not compromised by the demands of the wider results system.. But it's a massively complicated challenge for exam boards and regulator - made even more difficult by the conflicting legacies of previous grading systems.. Once there was a system of fixed quotas which prevented any rise in grades and then a system which allowed grades to rise every single year. Now there is a system which holds out the possibility of change, but which manages to keep things the same.. Another factor that gets overlooked in the headlines, is that the results can be changed by who is taking the exam.. This year's nudge upwards in the pass rate has come alongside an older cohort.. There are fewer 14 and 15 year olds taking the GCSEs early, because the league tables now only recognise the first attempt.. And another change in government policy means that pupils who missed out on GCSE maths and English last year are having to re-sit the exam this year. This means that more than 300,000 exam entries were from 17 year olds.. But if the changes at the overall level are measured in fractions of a percentage point, there are some very striking differences between England, Northern Ireland and Wales.. Northern Ireland's pupils are stretching their lead over everyone else, jumping by 0.7% to 78.7%. It raises the question how such results can be achieved when only 66% make the grade in Wales.. Not only is the Northern Ireland figure far ahead of England, it is ahead of the highest-achieving part of England, which was London with 72%.. England's education system has been in a state of almost constant reform since the late 1980s, but the latest results show it is Northern Ireland that is stretching further ahead.. When these regional differences are overlaid with the gender gap, it means that young women in Northern Ireland are doing much better than anyone else.. The scores from the GCSE top grades show the gap. Among entries from female pupils in Northern Ireland, 11.4% achieve A* grades. Among male pupils in Wales, the figure is 4.5%.. In England, 5.2% of entries from male pupils and 7.9% of female achieve these highest A* grades.. This sets a pattern for A-levels and university entry, with Northern Irish women the most likely in the UK to get university places.. Whether or not it is going to be consolation for England's school leaders, such comparisons are soon going to be impossible.. Because in a couple of years England's GCSEs will begin to be graded from 9 to 1 rather than A to G, ending a common system with Wales and Northern Ireland.. Another curious aside is that many of the pupils taking GCSEs this year in England did not take their Sats tests five years ago, because of a primary school teachers' boycott. What difference did it make in the long term?. It would take another exam to answer that one.","The GCSE results have been published, with over 5 million entries, and the overall national picture is very similar to last year, with a small increase in the proportion of A* to C grades.. However, there are concerns about the reliability of individual results and whether the system is fair for all students.. The exam boards and regulator must balance competing demands, such as maintaining standards over time and avoiding grade inflation, while also adjusting grades between different exam boards.. The results also show regional differences, with Northern Ireland's pupils performing better than those in England and Wales, and a gender gap, with young women in Northern Ireland doing better than anyone else.",,llama70b,XSUM

Well, perhaps that's not a complete analogy, but the national exam statistics, with their neat similarity to last year, are a work of design rather than nature.. The huge annual challenge for the exam system is to balance a number of competing demands. There has to be room for some slight ups and downs, but there mustn't be grade inflation, standards have to be maintained over time and - at the very heart of the process - it has to be a fair reward for the hard work of individual pupils.. Add to this complex equation the need to adjust grades between different exam boards.. Head teachers' leader Brian Lightman has complained that below the smooth surface of the national statistics, there can be doubts about the reliability of individual results.. He has warned of ""volatility"", with heads unable to explain sudden dips and spikes, problems that remain unnoticed from a national perspective.. ""It is devastating for a student who has been on course for a certain grade to miss what they were expected to achieve and it is mystifying to their teachers,"" said Mr Lightman.. The lingering question is if one year's results are reverse engineered to be very similar to the year before, does this mean distorting some of the results to make sure that they fit? Are there winners and losers in some subjects and at some grades?. Ofqual has always argued that fairness for individual students is not compromised by the demands of the wider results system.. But it's a massively complicated challenge for exam boards and regulator - made even more difficult by the conflicting legacies of previous grading systems.. Once there was a system of fixed quotas which prevented any rise in grades and then a system which allowed grades to rise every single year. Now there is a system which holds out the possibility of change, but which manages to keep things the same.. Another factor that gets overlooked in the headlines, is that the results can be changed by who is taking the exam.. This year's nudge upwards in the pass rate has come alongside an older cohort.. There are fewer 14 and 15 year olds taking the GCSEs early, because the league tables now only recognise the first attempt.. And another change in government policy means that pupils who missed out on GCSE maths and English last year are having to re-sit the exam this year. This means that more than 300,000 exam entries were from 17 year olds.. But if the changes at the overall level are measured in fractions of a percentage point, there are some very striking differences between England, Northern Ireland and Wales.. Northern Ireland's pupils are stretching their lead over everyone else, jumping by 0.7% to 78.7%. It raises the question how such results can be achieved when only 66% make the grade in Wales.. Not only is the Northern Ireland figure far ahead of England, it is ahead of the highest-achieving part of England, which was London with 72%.. England's education system has been in a state of almost constant reform since the late 1980s, but the latest results show it is Northern Ireland that is stretching further ahead.. When these regional differences are overlaid with the gender gap, it means that young women in Northern Ireland are doing much better than anyone else.. The scores from the GCSE top grades show the gap. Among entries from female pupils in Northern Ireland, 11.4% achieve A* grades. Among male pupils in Wales, the figure is 4.5%.. In England, 5.2% of entries from male pupils and 7.9% of female achieve these highest A* grades.. This sets a pattern for A-levels and university entry, with Northern Irish women the most likely in the UK to get university places.. Whether or not it is going to be consolation for England's school leaders, such comparisons are soon going to be impossible.. Because in a couple of years England's GCSEs will begin to be graded from 9 to 1 rather than A to G, ending a common system with Wales and Northern Ireland.. Another curious aside is that many of the pupils taking GCSEs this year in England did not take their Sats tests five years ago, because of a primary school teachers' boycott. What difference did it make in the long term?. It would take another exam to answer that one.","The results for more than five million GCSE entries have been published, showing a small increase in the proportion of students getting A* to C grades, from 68.8% to 69%..

In particular, the Information Commissioner's Office will be able to issue fines of up to 4% of global turnover, or 20m euros - whichever is highest. The regulator can only issues fines of up to £500,000 at present.. ""UK organisations must use the remaining time to prepare for GDPR compliance before May next year,"" said Stewart Room, an expert in global cybersecurity and data protection at PwC.. The UK is due to adopt the new rules before it leaves the EU, but PwC said it was unlikely to water down the protections after it left the union.","PwC has warned companies that they must prepare for new tougher EU rules on data protection or face big fines.. The new rules, which come into effect in May 2018, could see fines increase to 20 million euros or more.. PwC reported that fines for data breaches have already risen, with 35 issued in 2016, amounting to £3.2 million in total.. The UK is one of the most active places in Europe for regulatory enforcement in this area.. The new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will bring much tougher obligations and penalties, and the Information Commissioner's Office will be able to issue fines of up to 4% of global turnover or 20 million euros, whichever is higher.",2018,chatgpt,XSUM

[doctor] we did an x-ray before you saw me , so let's look at that . hey , dragon , show me the back x-ray . so looking here at this x-ray of the lumbar spine , everything looks good . there's good boney alignment . there's no obvious fracture , you know , which is not surprising based on your history . okay ?. [patient] hmm .. [doctor] hey , dragon , show me the labs . and your labs that we did before you came in all look great . there's no elevated white blood cell count . there's no signs of infection . again , those are all really good . okay ? so let me go over with you about my assessment and my plan for you . so for your first problem , this back pain , i think you have a lumbar strain , and , you know , that might've happened , you know , lifting something or exercising . and so what i want to do is prescribe meloxicam , 15 milligrams once a day . uh , i want you ... you can ice the area , and you can also apply heat sometimes as well . um , you know , i'm going to refer you to physical therapy just to do some strengthening exercises of your back , um , because i do want you to continue to be able to work out and exercise . okay ?. [patient] okay .. [doctor] and for your last problem , your high blood pressure , again , everything looks great here . um , you know , i think you're doing a really good job with that as well . i want you to continue on the lisinopril , 10 milligrams a day . and then , uh , let me know if you notice any increases in your blood pressure readings . okay ?. [patient] okay .. [doctor] do you need a refill of the lisinopril ?. [patient] yes , i do , actually .. [doctor] okay . hey , dragon ? order lisinopril 10 milligrams po daily . okay . uh , so the nurse will be in soon , and she'll get you checked out . okay ?. [patient] okay .. [doctor] all right . hey , dragon ? finalize the note .","Cheryl, a 34-year-old female with hypertension, presented with a six-day history of lower back pain.. She had been walking 30 minutes to an hour a day and felt like her back seized up while walking.. Initially, she took ibuprofen and applied heat to the area, but her pain persisted.. She denied any trauma, fever, chills, congestion, cough, chest pain, or shortness of breath, except for nasal congestion due to seasonal allergies.. Her blood pressure was well controlled on lisinopril.. Physical exam revealed pain to palpation on the right lateral aspect of her lumbar spine and pain with flexion and extension, but a negative straight leg raise.. X-rays of the lumbar spine showed good boney alignment",,geminipro,ACIBENCH

Clearly, whatever the EU does during this crisis, it will come under fire from some quarter or another.. All too often, it comes up against itself - a behemoth of 28 nations, struggling to work together.. Even the quota system - accepted (reluctantly) by most EU countries - to share out more equally the asylum seekers in Europe is an unmitigated flop so far.. Agreed number of people to be relocated: 160,000.. People moved to date: 147.. Cross-border co-operation is disintegrating as barbed wire goes up and borders slam shut across Europe: in Slovenia, Hungary, Austria, Sweden, Norway…. Even Germany is toughening border regulations.. In stark contrast to the warm welcome given to hundreds or thousands earlier this autumn, Wolfgang Schaeuble, Germany's hugely popular finance minister, has begun to mutter darkly about a migrant ""avalanche"" engulfing his country.. There's little evidence of the EU - more of each country for itself.. That prompted the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, to warn that Schengen, the EU agreement allowing passport-free travel across much of Europe, risks collapse. Yet it is one of the EU's proudest achievements.. You could argue Schengen has already wilted and died.","The European Union (EU) has been struggling to handle the recent surge of migrants and refugees arriving in Europe.. In response, the EU has attempted to persuade the migrants' countries of origin, or the transit countries, to stem the flow of migrants.. The EU has offered financial assistance and other aid to these countries, but these offers have been largely rejected as insufficient.. The EU has also been criticized for its lack of transparency and accountability in its dealings with these countries.. The EU's efforts to strike deals with countries like Turkey, which is now the main departure point for refugees and other migrants crossing to Europe, have also been met with criticism.. Critics argue that the EU is willing to compromise its values by cooperating with countries with poor human rights",and accountability,geminipro,XSUM

[doctor] okay , and is he stuffy too ?. [patient_guest] yeah . yeah .. [doctor] okay , and have you noticed , is his mucous clear right now ?. [patient_guest] it is , it is right now , yes .. [doctor] okay . and , does he also have a cough ?. [patient_guest] yes , but it's not barky .. [doctor] and does he act like he has a sore throat or is he pulling on his ears ?. [patient_guest] well , i know he's been pulling on his ears , yeah .. [doctor] okay .. [patient_guest] you know , he also , he's also been going crazy rubbing at his nose too .. [doctor] okay . and , any fever you've noticed ?. [patient_guest] i checked his rectal temperature and it was 100.3 .. [doctor] okay . so , a little bit of a low-grade fever there , definitely . and , how was his appetite ? did he eat last night ?. [patient_guest] yes , he did . yeah .. [doctor] and how about this morning ? did he eat his breakfast ?. [patient_guest] uh , this morning he ate about seven ounces from the bottle .. [doctor] okay .. [patient_guest] and then he got another bottle , and he barely ate that . um , i offered him cereal and he would n't eat that either .. [doctor] okay .. [patient_guest] so , he varies i guess .. [doctor] how is his energy ? does he seem like he wants to take more naps , or does he have pretty good energy ?. [patient_guest] mmm , it seems like he's irritable .. [doctor] irritable because he is n't feeling good ?. [patient_guest] yeah . he is energetic , but it seems like he ca n't go to sleep , like , he's fighting it really hard .. [doctor] okay , and just for the chart , is there anyone , anybody else exposed to him who has been sick ?. [patient_guest] yes , his older sister's been sick .. [doctor] thank you .. [patient_guest] we also had a play date with my nephew , who i learned later had a sinus infection .. [doctor] and what medication have you tried for him ? anything at all ?. [patient_guest] um , i've been doing the saline mist in his nose .. [doctor] good , good . that's a good choice .. [patient_guest] i did give him tylenol really early this morning because he was warm when i took the sleeper off of him , and we had the ac on in the house , but his whole body was sweating .. [doctor] i see . and , any other medications ?. [patient_guest] we did put some baby vick's on his feet last night to try and help him breathe . and , i also used the humidifier .. [doctor] okay . that's good .. [patient_guest] okay . okay .. [doctor] so , there was another thing i wanted to bring up since we're here . it appears that his cradle cap has gotten a little worse . what are you using on it ?. [patient_guest] i've been using the cradle cap brush , and then i use regular aveno shampoo .. [doctor] is it a dandruff shampoo ?. [patient_guest] no , i do n't think so .. [doctor] okay , thank you . well , let's complete his exam and then we'll talk about the next steps .. [patient_guest] okay , sounds good .. [doctor] can you take a big breath randy .. [patient_guest] where's mama ?. [doctor] do n't forget to breathe little one . okay . let's try the front too .. [patient_guest] yeah , it's okay buddy .. [doctor] excellent . he's doing excellent . next let's- let's check out those ears .. [patient_guest] okay .. [doctor] let's try to make sure you do n't tip all the way over .. [patient_guest] dino , you're doing so good .. [doctor] all right . ears look okay . we're going to slide you forward so you do n't bump your head when i lay you down .. [patient_guest] hey , you're- hey you're okay . you're okay .. [doctor] okay , you can go ahead and sit him back up if you like .. [patient_guest] all right . thank you .. [doctor] all right . so , he's just kind of getting started with this , and i think we're seeing something viral right now . often sinus infections will start out as a virus and then will become bacterial infections if left alone and does n't go away . but , i do n't think he needs any antibiotics , at least not at this point in time . um , keep up with the fluids , rest , and i would watch him very carefully for a barking cough . if he does get a barky cough , then that tends to be a little bit more significant and a little more severe . so , if he develops a barky cough , i want you to give him a half a teaspoon of his sister's medicine .. [doctor] you know , i'm almost tempted to give you some of the medicine because they're probably sharing the same virus .. [patient_guest] okay .. [doctor] actually , i will . i'll go ahead and just give you some as well .. [patient_guest] okay . okay .. [doctor] but , if he does n't become barky , you do n't have to use it . it only works for the barky cough .. [patient_guest] mm-hmm , got it .. [doctor] okay . we'll do the same thing with him , as long as nothing gets worse , and we'll see him back in one week . so , it wo n't get rid of a regular cough . he can use zarbee's , but use the dose for kids under a year of age . so , if you wan na get some of that , you can definitely try that for him , it can help out a little bit with the regular cough .","A 2-year-old patient named Randy Gutierrez was seen for a follow-up appointment..

639,Rachel Usher#ACIBENCH-D2N114:mistral7b-ul2,[doctor] alright. [patient] good morning Julie how are you doing today. [doctor] i'm doing okay i'm just a little nervous about what's been going on with my headaches. [patient] okay so i know you were sent here by your your pcp what was your understanding of why you were sent here. [doctor] yeah so i actually have been someone who been struggling with headaches for years now ever since i was a teenager and they used to be around my when i would have my menstrual my menses but as i got older i noticed that it has been with that and also i can get it when i'm really stressed but recently and why i went to her is because my headaches have been getting a lot more they've just been happening a lot more frequently and a lot more severe. [patient] okay can you tell me a little bit about them what how do they how do they feel when they come on. [doctor] so they say mostly on my right side and it even seems like it's like behind my eye and it just like this pulsing like this really bad pulsing sensation. [patient] okay do you notice these any activities or time of the day that makes them worse i know you said they they seem to get worse around your menstrual periods but is there any time of the day or that makes them worse. [doctor] i i have noticed that you know i've been trying to exercise more in order to lose weight but i ca n't even really exercise for very long because i start of as soon as i start to jog i my headaches the headaches come back on a lot worse so i notice it when i'm exercising. [patient] okay and do you seem to have any other symptoms when you get these headaches i've been having a ringing in my ears for a few months now and then what really scared me is that now i'm starting to get some blurred vision it's not all the time but it it will come and go but some blurred like on the. [doctor] in my on the side of my vision. [patient] okay okay and have you experienced any numbness or tingling to your hands or feet or your face. [doctor] no i have n't. [patient] okay so you you like to run a lot what kind of do you do you use a a good shoe you know what kind of shoes do you use for your running. [doctor] yeah i yeah i i'm starting to get back into it i'm a big new balance person in asics so yeah those are the two brands i like to wear yeah so right now i'm using asics. [patient] okay yeah i like to run too and i use nike. [doctor] okay. [patient] i used to get tumor guy but i i really kinda moved over to nike. [doctor] hmmm. [patient] that's good you know it is running is a great exercise. [doctor] it is. [patient] so have you had any let's get back to the exam here have you had a recent mri of your brain i saw one from a few years ago but as doctor white said anything about getting a more a recent mri. [doctor] yeah she was gon na put one in but she wanted me to see you first and urgently so they have n't called me yet for the mri. [patient] okay so that's good we i think we'll we will follow up with that mri but let's go ahead and take a do a quick physical exam here i reviewed your vitals that the the assistant collected when you came in and everything there looks good including your blood pressure you know with symptoms like that that's one of those things that i'd be concerned about. [doctor] okay. [patient] now on your heart exam it sounds like it's normal sinus rhythm with no murmurs rubs or gallops so that's good as i listen i'm gon na go ahead and look here in your eyes the funduscopic exam shows papilledema and that's just some of swelling behind there in the eye and this let me do a a neurological exam this will take a few minutes you get up to follow my instructions as we go through that okay on neurological exam your cranial nerves one through twelve are intact including a normal cranial reflex and just went to watch you walk across the room here. [doctor] okay turn around come back and okay so on musculoskeletal exam your gait is normal. [doctor] okay go ahead sorry. [patient] that's okay for your first problem your headaches your symptoms are concerning for what we call idiopathic intracranial hypertension and this is a condition that that you have increased pressure in the in your head in your brain without any known cause for it now patient also presents with often present with symptoms such as yours you know headaches worsening with activity ringing in the ears changes in your vision so i'm i'm pretty confident that that's what we're having here now why we get concerned is if the pressure continues to increase this can lead to some permanent changes in your vision so i i do wan na get a a few more tests just so we can confirm that diagnosis and the first one that we just talked about is an mri i think it's really important to get that to check for any other condition that could be contributing to your symptoms now once i have that result i'm gon na be doing also doing a spinal tap which will help me evaluate the pressure in the brain and it can also help you feel better if you do have an increased pressure by taking the decreasing the amount of that pressure just by taking a a a little bit of fluid off of that and lastly i want you to be seen by a neuro-ophthalmologist for a complete eye exam now i i know that sounds like a lot of information but i think it's really important we get that accomplished do you have any questions for me. [doctor] yeah that is a lot and so i i'm sure i'll have more that comes up but so let's say we do all this test and it confirms what you're saying does that mean was i referred to you because that means i will need surgery. [patient] not necessarily if you have idiopathic intracranial hypertension there are number of medications that we can try to help decrease that pressure in your brain and this will also help you have less headaches when you exercise as exercise and weight loss are also an important part of the treatment. [doctor] okay alright alright and i'll probably add something about so is this something i'll be doing soon is this all things i'll be doing this week. [patient] yeah that's a great question here i i'm gon na go ahead and we're gon na for the mri i'll have to get a preapproval from your insurance company i will work on that my my my team in the front office will get that preapproved and then once that's done we'll call you to help schedule that mri. [doctor] okay alright thank you bye. [patient] bye sorry,"The doctor and patient are discussing the patient's headaches and their recent increase in frequency and severity..

[doctor] okay alright good so let me examine you now so tyler i'm examining you now i'm gon na just verbalize some of my findings your neck is fine i do n't see any swelling in your neck your thyroid feels normal i do n't feel any masses in your neck there's no lymph nodes i'm looking at your throat and that looks okay there is no masses or any swelling that i can see there is no redness yeah there is no carotid bruit your lung exam is clear your heart exam is normal no murmurs on your belly exam you have some epigastric tenderness right here in the right here where i'm pressing but i do n't feel any masses or any significant swelling back there no normal back exam your extremity exam looks normal your neurological exam's fine so for this difficulty swallowing i'm concerned that you may have a narrowing in your throat that's causing this and sometimes it can be from a stricture where some narrowing of the esophagus and sometimes i need to go in and dilate that so i'm gon na go ahead and send you give you a referral for gastroenterology and have them do a scope and take a look down there i'm gon na recommend we put you on some prilosec sometimes also reflux medicine can if you have reflux sometimes that can also exacerbate this sometimes so i'm gon na put you on some prilosec twenty milligrams once a day again i'm gon na recommend that you chew your foods frequently and make sure you have a you know especially if you're eating something hard like steak or meat chew them really well so they do n't get tend to get stuck some people have sometimes things get stuck and they do n't go down and if that happens as an emergency you do have to go to the emergency department but seems like you know things are going down they just seem to sometimes slow down or get stuck temporarily so why do n't i get you a referral for gi we will start you on the prilosec and then we will have you you know if you you know if you have any other symptoms or worsenings give my office a call we will get you in or get you referred to the er if needed any questions about that. [patient] no that sounds great. [doctor] okay and for the diabetes i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c i'm gon na order some more blood work today we'll check a kidney function and i notice that you have not had an eye referral so i'm gon na also give you an eye referral to ophthalmology to check your eyes for your diabetic for your for any retinopathy continue the metformin i'll have you come back in about a month and that way we'll have the results back for the blood test if we need to make any adjustments we can but i i wan na see you back in about a month and i think that's it for that any questions about that. [patient] no. [doctor] okay and the high blood pressure i think you're doing great continue with the norvasc if you have any issues certainly call me but otherwise there is really nothing else to add for that did we forget anything or do you need refills for anything. [patient] you know i think i'm low on the norvasc so if you could send something to my pharmacy that would be great. [doctor] okay sure i'll get you a refill for norvasc we'll get that sent over to the pharmacy okay. [patient] thank you. [doctor] alright thanks good seeing you thanks for coming in to them,"Tyler, a 56-year-old male, presented with difficulty swallowing for the past 4-5 weeks.. He felt like something was stuck in his throat, especially when swallowing solids.. He had no coughing, blood in stools, vomiting, weight loss, chest pain, or shortness of breath.. His diabetes was managed with metformin, and his blood sugar levels were within the target range.. His blood pressure was generally well-controlled with norvasc.. On examination, his neck, thyroid, throat, lungs, heart, and abdomen were normal.. The doctor suspected a narrowing in the throat causing the difficulty swallowing and recommended a referral to gastroenterology for a scope..

[patient] yeah , there were a couple days there i took an extra one , just because there was a little extra pain in my feet . and i do have a desk job , so when i have a day off where i'm moving around a lot they do tend to hurt a bit more .. [doctor] okay . how many times did you do that ?. [patient] um , it was n't often , maybe once a week .. [doctor] okay . so it sounds like we're still on track for discontinuing the prednisone . we'll do that today and you can let me know how it goes on your next visit . and how about the methotrexate , do you think that helped with your joint pain ?. [patient] yeah , definitely . because i went to get my covid shots , um , but from the letter i got about it , it said that it could interfere with the vaccine , you know , reduce the efficacy . so i did n't take it on the week that i got the first shot .. [doctor] okay . and what happened ?. [patient] i felt absolutely horrible until i took it again a week later .. [doctor] i'm sorry to hear that . and- and what did you do about the second dose ?. [patient] well , i called into the hotline because i was in so much pain with the first one . and they said , "" no , just go ahead and take it , "" so i did .. [doctor] okay . that's good then . we do have to keep an eye out on it since it's a high-risk medication . do you have an appointment to get your blood drawn for the next time ?. [patient] no , they did n't give me one .. [doctor] okay . so we can do that for you too . uhm , so what questions do you have for me , judy ?. [patient] well , i just wanted to know why i was getting all these bruises here , so like when i bump myself . i do n't know where they're coming from .. [doctor] okay . that's probably from the prednisone , it can increase bruising .. [patient] okay . i did n't know that . um , i do n't even feel it when it happens , they just show up .. [doctor] yeah . unfortunately that can happen , but we're working on discontinuing that so let's see if the bruises do go away .. [patient] okay . that sounds good , thanks .. [doctor] okay , judy , please , um , sit up here and i'll take a look . shoes and socks off please .. [patient] all right .. [doctor] all right . let me see here . okay . so where is it hurting ? in your joints right here ?. [patient] yeah , a little . also in my feet joints as well .. [doctor] okay . and how about when you bend the knee like this ?. [patient] well , it hurt before we increased the methotrexate , but it's doing pretty good now .. [doctor] okay , good . can you flex your toes please ? good range of motion . also ridges in nails , that's from the psoriasis .. [patient] yeah . they've been like that for a long time now .. [doctor] okay . all right , uhm , ms gomez , it looks like we're moving along with your treatment nicely . we'll stop your prednisone and continue with the methotrexate . make sure to stop by the front desk and make an appointment for the blood work , and i'll see you in three months .. [patient] all right . it sounds good . thank you so much , it was great to see you .. [doctor] it was great seeing you too . thank you .","Judy Gomez, born on 5th July 1961, visited her doctor for the management of her psoriatic arthritis.. She has been taking prednisone and methotrexate for her condition.. She has managed to reduce her prednisone dose to one a day but occasionally increases the dose due to increased pain, especially during her off days from her desk job.. The doctor recommends discontinuing the use of prednisone given her progress and also because it could be the cause of the unexplained bruising she had observed.. The methotrexate has definitely helped with Judy's joint pain and she was advised to continue with it.",,gpt4,ACIBENCH

The aim is to learn more about the behaviour of a species that experts say could cause millions of pounds of damage to crops if left untreated.. Usually, if you want to study an animal, you do a survey and count it.. The problem with slugs is you can't always see them as they spend much of their time out of sight in the top 10cm (4in) of the ground.. But improved tracking technology will allow scientists to accurately follow slug movements for the first time.. The aim of the research is to answer an interesting problem facing farmers: how do slugs live amongst their crops?. The researchers at Harper Adams University have a theory slugs are not evenly distributed over a field.. Instead they believe they are concentrated in patches.. That's important because if the scientists could help farmers find these large patches of slugs you could target them with pest control measures. That would be cheaper and greener than spreading chemicals over an entire field.. Slugs are slimy and enjoy squeezing into tight spaces so the trackers need to be placed inside the slugs themselves just under the skin.. The slugs are anaesthetised before a small cut is made in the skin and the tracker inserted. The tracker itself is smaller than a grain of rice.. The slugs I saw were implanted a month ago and seemed happy.. It's important to the researchers that the trackers don't cause the slugs to behave any differently to their non-implanted cousins. In the lab it appears neither slug movement or appetite is affected.. Tracking the slugs involves equipment that looks very like a metal detector. Researchers will go out at night when the slugs are most active and release the slugs with the trackers. There will be hundreds of them over the duration of the experiment.. Then every 20 minutes throughout the night the team will scan the fields with the detector. This will automatically log the slug's individual tracker number and it's GPS location building up a very accurate map of where the slugs go and what they are doing.. There's increasing pressure on farmers to reduce the chemicals they use against slugs and some are being banned outright. So if this research comes up with a better way to control them by revealing more about their behaviour it could be very useful.. Funding for this study has come from the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB), The Potato Council and Cereals and Oilseeds who estimate that slugs could cause Â£100m of damage to UK crops if they aren't properly controlled.. And finally a confession.. We did take a slug out into the field and we put it down on the ground to track it. We certainly managed to find it again, the signal from its tracker was loud and strong, but we couldn't actually see it. Which means we couldn't recover the slug and he had to go and join his colleagues in the soil. It did rather show how trackers beat traditional visual slug surveys..
