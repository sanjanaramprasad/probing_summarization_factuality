The study will use improved tracking technology to accurately follow slug movements for the first time, and could provide a better way to control them by revealing more about their behavior.. The study has received funding from several organizations, including the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, The Potato Council, and Cereals and Oilseeds.. Despite one slug being lost during the study, the researchers are confident in the technology and the results it will provide.'"
