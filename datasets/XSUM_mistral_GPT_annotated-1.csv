5,"Mourinho could not afford any mistakes in this third-round tie after Premier League defeats by Manchester City and Watford, with a Europa League loss to Feyenoord sandwiched in between.
It was eventually smooth passage, assisted by Northampton keeper Adam Smith, who endured a nightmare evening and played a big part in two of United's goals.
The highly rated 23-year-old picked up a back pass in the 17th minute and when Wayne Rooney's resulting free-kick was blocked, the recalled Michael Carrick fired home the loose ball emphatically.
Alex Revell gave the Cobblers hope of a shock from the penalty spot just before half-time after Daley Blind fouled Sam Hoskins - but this was not the night for an upset.
United regrouped and Ander Herrera's powerful drive put them in front after 68 minutes before Smith's misery was complete seven minutes later when he missed a simple long clearance to allow substitute Marcus Rashford to roll the ball into an empty net.
Relive Wednesday's EFL Cup action
Jose Mourinho has been reluctant to use the 35-year-old England midfield man since his arrival at Old Trafford. This was his first start since Manchester United's win against Leicester City in the Community Shield at Wembley.
On this evidence he surely has a strong case to force his way into Mourinho's plans - not least because he possesses the style and composure to bring the best from United's £89m world record signing Paul Pogba.
Pogba has looked restricted in his early performances and the selection of Carrick, so reliable in possession and even chipping in with a goal here, would allow the France midfield man freedom, play to his strengths and give him the opportunity to do damage further forward.
Carrick's experience and expert reading of the game adds to Mourinho's options and could finally bring the best from his showpiece summer signing. Surely he will start against Leicester City at Old Trafford on Saturday.
As Pogba got the night off and Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Rashford started on the bench with Mourinho making nine changes from United's 3-1 loss to Watford at Vicarage Road, there was no respite for Rooney.
United's embattled captain, who has bore the brunt of much of the criticism aimed at the side this season, was in the starting line-up but endured another night of frustration.
He worked hard but nothing is coming off for the 30-year-old. He missed one easy chance early on and when he did hit the target after Timothy Fosu-Mensah's header hit the bar, he was adjudged offside.
With Carrick and Herrera excelling and with a host of attacking options available to Mourinho, will Rooney's place come under threat against Leicester City at Old Trafford at the weekend?
Northampton may not have been able to spring the big shock and increase the woes for Mourinho by knocking Manchester United out of the EFL Cup - but there was still plenty for the club lying 11th in League One to be pleased about.
The neat Sixfields stadium was packed with a record crowd of 7,798. With a new stand in the process of being built, the club can be proud of the way it handled the big occasion.
Northampton's 31-game unbeaten run ended with defeat by Chesterfield on Saturday and for spells they showed United too much respect. This is, perhaps, understandable, but this was a night when Northampton as a club did itself great credit.
If there was a sadness, it was the disappointment suffered by keeper Smith, who has attracted Premier League attention but was badly at fault here.
Smith was included in the League Two team of the season as the Cobblers clinched the title in the previous campaign. There will be better days ahead for a talented young goalkeeper.
Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho: ""It was as difficult as I was expecting but we looked to be in control for the first 35 minutes and then we looked to be in control for the last 45. I think the team was in control from the beginning and the subs were just a contribution.
""The game should be easier, we should have been playing against 10 men very early in the second half. Northampton fought and they tried to cause us problems which sometimes they did but it was a positive performance overall.
""I don't like to individualise the players, I think it was fine, the midfield were in control.""
Northampton manager Rob Page: ""When you get back in to it at 1-1 you never know.
""I'm really proud of the players, we had to be disciplined. They've had a tough week by their standards but we knew we had to be strong. When you give away soft goals you will get punished.
""He (goalkeeper Adam Smith) was outstanding last season and he'll bounce back from this. He's a strong character, we've all had moments like that as players.""

It had two other ships on order for nearly £17m, using a loan from Santander bank.
But it ran into cash flow problems early this year as the oil price fell.
Administrators at PwC said the daily spot price for hiring offshore vessels dropped from £18,000 to only £3,000.
Prices reflected oil production firms cutting costs and exploration.
The administrators transferred Fletcher Shipping assets to a new company, FS Shipping, in a so-called 'pre-pack' deal.
This was financed with £18m, raised through Grovepoint Capital.
The main assets of Fletcher Shipping, founded in 2007, were the FS Pegasus, FS Aquarius, FS Pisces and FS Taurus.
The pre-pack deal means the operations continue uninterrupted, while shareholders lose out and creditors only recover some of their lending to the collapsed firm.
According to administrators, the transaction had no employment impact, as the vessels crews were contract staff working for other firms.
Keith Fletcher, founder of Fletcher Shipping, said: ""It is testament to the strong reputation of the crews and personnel at Fletcher Shipping that we have secured the confidence of new investors who have helped us recapitalise our business.
""We have worked hard to keep our fleet working throughout the recent downturn in the North Sea - a downturn which has affected the vessel market more harshly than I have witnessed in 30 years of business.
The Scottish Loan Fund is part of the Scottish Investment Bank, which is the investing arm of Scottish Enterprise, the Scottish government's economic development agency.
The loan fund is run by Maven Capital to meet gaps in the market for funding company growth.
Fletcher Shipping had a £5m investment from public funds over 2012 and 2013, as part of a consortium with the Royal Bank of Scotland and Maven Capital client funds.
At the time of announcing the funding package, the head of the Scottish Investment Bank, Kerry Sharp, said: ""Fletcher Shipping is exactly the kind of company the Scottish Loan Fund was established to support. It has excellent potential.""","Fletcher Shipping, a Scottish shipping company, ran into cash flow problems due to the fall in oil prices.

8,"However, a documentary called Tickled shines a spotlight on those who take part in it, when a TV reporter from New Zealand, David Farrier, uncovers not just a quirky sport, but a whole industry, and an underworld with allegations of cyber bullying.
Two years ago, Farrier, known for his ""and finally"" news pieces at his local TV station, discovered what was described as ""competitive endurance tickling"" videos online.
They featured young men in professional sportswear tickling each other.
A US-based company, Jane O'Brien Media, was producing the videos and offering substantial fees for anyone selected to take part in the shoots in Los Angeles.
""Right in the beginning I thought it was entirely innocent, perhaps with a subtext,"" explains Farrier.  ""I thought it was someone's idea of a funny strange sport, as it was in a photography studio, a professional space. All the men were wearing sportswear so I thought it was someone's odd idea of a tickling league.""
""I was intrigued and thought about doing a two-minute feature on it for my show, ""he adds, ""so I got in touch with them. Really, a short feature was all I was aiming for.""
In response however, Farrier, who is bisexual, says he received emails stating that the company did not want to deal with ""a homosexual journalist"".
""I was a little upset but part of me thought it was funny,"" he adds. ""I didn't understand why a company that makes men-only tickling videos would say that.""
""Instinct, intrigue and fascination"" drove him and his co-director Dylan Reeve on to find out more about the videos, despite representatives of the company flying to Auckland to threaten legal action. Farrier successfully raised the money for a documentary using the crowd-funding platform, Kickstarter.
""We probably did go into it quite naively,"" he believes.
""We never expected to find what we did. If you watch the film you'll find it's not really about tickling - it's about power.
""We were interested in the psychology of what made these men take part in the videos, and it was mainly guys who were athletes or military, and from poorer states.""
Although being tickled usually provokes laughter, science has long been interested in whether it's involuntary. Ten years ago, a study at the University of California at San Diego concluded that tickling did not necessarily produce pleasure, just the outward appearance of it.
Alan J Fridlund, a social and clinical psychologist, points out that whether it's enjoyable or not ""depends upon the social context of the tickle. Charles Darwin thought that infant tickling was the basis of adult humour and I agree"".
He added: ""But the insidious side of tickling is that if the tickler has a perverse motive, they will interpret the reflexive responses to tickling as a sign of approval, even when the social context turns dark.
""As the tickler proceeds, he or she is abetted by the nasty fact that strong tickling begins to cause cataplexy, a generalised weakening of the body's striate muscles, and one that many of us have known if we've been 'tickle tortured'. ""
That phrase is repeated by a participant of the tickling videos called TJ, who tells Farrier on camera that he was told taking part ""was for a project, as tickling was being considered as a military tactic for the army, tickle torture. I thought that was untrue"".
TJ says the reason he did it was ""because I was a little desperate for money. I was young at the time and I didn't think anything of it. I would get $2,000.
""On the day, I noticed it was all guys, and I didn't know I would get tied down, but there were athletes there, bodybuilders, a couple of actors I had seen on TV commercials - completely normal people. I still thought, 'I hope no one finds out about this'.""
In the documentary, TJ alleges that after the videos surfaced online, he asked them to be taken down, and was subjected to a campaign of abuse and harassment - including emails being sent to his employer at a high school.
The film claims others involved with making tickling videos have suffered controlling and abusive behaviour. However, Jane O'Brien Media strongly denies any wrongdoing.
The director confesses that his own viewpoint on tickling has shifted since making the film - and getting tickled himself for the purpose of making the documentary.
""There is pain in tickling, it's not always enjoyable. You're not laughing in the way you laugh as a joke. It can be used as torture and power play. There's also always one who is dominant, and one who is submissive. It's a metaphor for the power and control we talk about in the film.
""The innocence of it has gone for me - I don't tickle my nieces any more.""
The one word to sum up his experience, Farrier adds, is ""weird"".
""I was completely bemused a lot of the time about  what I was discovered. You couldn't actually make it up. Some people though think we have - they think it's so unbelievable that it's a spoof mockumentary.""

Durham and England seamer Mark Wood, 25, who only made his Test debut against New Zealand at Lord's in May, reflects on his achievement in taking the wicket that sealed his country's Ashes series victory against Australia at Trent Bridge on Saturday in just his fifth Test match.
Those are the moments you play the game for, the moments you dream about growing up. I just can't believe it was me.
There was a special atmosphere at Trent Bridge on Saturday. Every morning of a Test, they play 'Jerusalem' over the public address, but this is the first time I've ever known the crowd sing louder than the speakers.
I knew I would be bowling at the start because I had an over to complete from the night before, but captain Alastair Cook joked that unless I bowled four good balls I would be coming off.
The hairs were standing up on the back of my neck. I was thinking: ""I could win the Ashes for England here.""
The problem was that my Durham team-mate Ben Stokes kept bowling at the tailenders, leaving me to bowl at the established batsman Adam Voges. I had a bit of a laugh and joke with him, telling him ""no wonder you've got a six-for"".
Then Voges dug out a yorker and ran a single and I sensed I had a chance.
Australia number 10 Josh Hazlewood shows you a little bit of his stumps when he bats so I thought I'd bowl him a couple of shorter ones to let him know I was there and then have a go at the stumps. I got it exactly where I wanted and it bowled him.
Then came their number 11, Nathan Lyon, and the pressure was on. I could feel the crowd and the expectation. Stuart Broad kept shouting from mid-on that we were one ball away from winning the Ashes.
My first ball was too wide and the second was too straight. Come on Woody, get it right, I thought to myself. I went back to my mark and ran in. It was full and he couldn't get his bat out of the way in time. The ball hit the under-edge and shattered the stumps.
I jumped in the air and, as I turned, Jos Buttler grabbed me. Before I knew it we were all in a big huddle with me in the middle. People were shouting and screaming and I couldn't hear a thing. It was just manic.
When I got home my dad showed me the footage on TV and asked me what Cook was shouting to me but I told him I had no idea. It was that loud.
Eventually we broke away and Cook handed me, Stokesy and Joe Root a stump each. It was a brilliant gesture. He could easily have taken one for himself but he gave them to the young lads who had contributed to the win.
Once we got into the dressing room I thought I could let my emotions out a bit so I started hugging the team masseur and physio. Then I looked up and saw Sky Sports presenter Ian Ward lurking in the corner with a TV camera.
For a moment, I got a bit serious but when Ian Bell started giving an interview I couldn't resist standing behind him and dancing around. Then Rooty put on a mask and did his Bob Willis impression and we all just cracked up laughing.
The best moment of all was leaving the dressing room to do a lap of honour. I don't think I'll ever forget that. Just seeing what winning the Ashes meant to so many people was truly amazing.
When we were halfway round the field, Root and Cook came up to me and told me I had to bring out my imaginary horse, which has become my party piece when it gets boring in the field.
I've been keeping him in the stables all summer and I wasn't keen but they weren't taking no for an answer, so I checked the grass and let it fly for half a bend. I was a bit tired after my bowling spell so I think it was more of a trot than a gallop, but the crowd seemed to enjoy it.
We did some interviews on the field and everyone was a bit emotional. But when the skipper told that joke on the podium about how our coach Trevor Bayliss had only just turned up, it really lightened the mood.
Everyone could see what it meant to him, but to crack a gag at such a big moment really summed up our approach. We've wanted to have fun all series, to express ourselves and play exciting cricket.
Back in the dressing room, it was time for me to roll out the team song I'd been asked to write by Bayliss. He must think I'm either a lyrical genius or just that I have the best craic.
Either way, I spent a lot of time at Edgbaston and Trent Bridge working on it with Jimmy Anderson as my sidekick. We came up with some words for the lads to sing that seemed to go down pretty well and then we sang a special one for Broad because he was man of the match.
I can't reveal the lyrics of the songs... but maybe I will after The Oval.
We stayed in the dressing room until about 8.30pm singing songs and drinking. Being tee-total, I was on the water and orange juice but I still ended up with beer all over me.
Eventually we headed back to the hotel to spend a bit of time with our wives and girlfriends in the bar.
We were there until about midnight and then a few of the lads went out until the early hours. I won't name names, although I definitely heard Stokesy arriving back because his voice is very familiar.
He seemed to have forgotten his room key and was screaming at the door for his partner Claire to let him in. It went on for about half an hour so she was either in a deep sleep or wanted to teach him a lesson!
The reaction has been unbelievable. As well as the usual family members and friends, I've been getting texts and tweets from people I haven't heard from for years. Everyone seems to come out of the woodwork when something like this happens.
When I got home to Ashington in Northumberland on Sunday afternoon, I was expecting my parents to have put the bunting up, but they kept it low key. I've had a few people coming up to me to say well done, but it's been nice to relax and be myself.
I'll be seeing all my mates from the local cricket club on Tuesday. I can't wait to hear what they've got to say. No doubt they'll bring me straight back down to earth.
It will be nice to have a mental break and recharge the batteries before heading back down the M1 next Monday to join up with the squad and start preparing for the fifth Test at The Oval.
Australia will be up for the challenge. They will want to spoil the party and send captain Michael Clarke off into retirement with a big celebration, but we've got to make sure we don't give them a sniff.
Even if it means I'm made to gallop round the boundary on my imaginary horse belting out the team song, I'm desperate to win the series 4-1.

Watford's next manager will be their ninth in five years and the eighth since the Italian Pozzo family took over the club in 2012.
Chairman Scott Duxbury announced the latest exit after the board ""discussed goals and aspirations"" with Mazzarri.
""It was decided he will be stepping down from his position as the club's head coach,"" said Duxbury.

Chelsea striker Diego Costa and Baggies centre-back Gareth McAuley became embroiled in a tussle, and as referee Mike Jones tried to restore order, Fabregas kicked the ball at the group of players around the referee, hitting Brunt on the head.

21,"Unlike many other homelessness initiatives, the so-called ""Housing First"" approach doesn't require homeless people to make steps towards solving other issues like alcoholism, mental health problems or drug addiction before they get accommodation.
Four experts talk to the BBC World Service Inquiry programme about how and why the approach works and some of its limitations.
Dr Sam Tsemberis is a clinical psychologist who founded Pathways to Housing in New York City in 1992, and developed the Housing First model.
""In the 1980s I was working at Bellevue Psychiatric Hospital on the east side of Manhattan, and I walked about 30 blocks to work.
""I began to walk past people that I recognised, people I had treated when I was working on the inpatient service at the hospital. They had gotten discharged, and were on the street, sometimes literally in the pyjamas that they had been discharged with from the hospital. It was quite disturbing.
""Many of them told me over and over again, 'I need a place to stay, a simple, decent, affordable place of my own like I had before I became homeless'.
""People had to participate in psychiatric treatment or be clean and sober in order to get housing. That was a precondition. And curing addiction or curing mental illness is still something we don't know how to do, and that was exactly what was being asked of people. It was an impossible hurdle to jump over.
""We began to do something that no-one had really done before, which was to take people on the street and offer them a place to live, no conditions other than sign the lease and pay your rent.
""The other breakthrough was to offer normal housing. We rented housing from community landlords on the open market, and people lived in apartments with families, older people, younger people, students, people of all types, including some people who had just the day before been homeless, but were homeless no longer.
""In that first year we had 50 people. The rule-of-thumb in most treatment programmes is a third do better, a third do worse and a third stay the same.
""At the end of the first year 84% were still housed: 84% of people who had been on the street for years. We knew we were onto something very important.
""At first it was misunderstood, and I think people were very uncomfortable because they thought of it as enabling something that should be earned, but if you back up from moral judgments, homeless people are already suffering and providing them with a house actually gets us much closer to the goal that we all want.
""We all want people off the streets and living a productive, meaningful life. This is just a much quicker, more effective and cost-saving way of getting to exactly that goal.""
Former music executive Philip Mangano was inspired to start helping homeless people after watching a film about St Francis of Assisi. He left his job to volunteer at his local church. Twenty years later he was appointed President George W Bush's homelessness czar, where he came across Sam Tsemberis' work.
""We had some very good research that indicated that a certain portion [20%] of homeless people were experiencing what was termed 'chronic' homelessness; they were homeless for a year or more and had a disability or concurring disabilities. So as a policy decision in Washington, we decided that we would focus specifically on that population of homeless people.
""I heard about a guy in New York who was placing people directly into housing off the streets and frankly, I was completely agnostic that that could be done, but I thought if that works, we better know about it.
""He took me to a number of people that had been housed, and it looked as though Sam had uncovered something that was in a blind spot for the entire issue for a quarter of a century. So I was interested in the tangible aspects of it, but I really wanted to look at the data. Was there confirming data and research that indicated that this approach worked? Yes there was. So I was a convert to Housing First.
""One of the key questions became how can we possibly afford housing for all these people?
""How much did homeless people cost when they were randomly ricocheting through very expensive health and law enforcement systems, the emergency room of the hospital, police interventions, court costs, and incarceration costs? How much did that cost, versus how much did it cost for people when they were placed in housing?
""Every single study we did revealed that it was less costly to provide the housing and the services than it was to have those people randomly ricocheting in expensive health and law enforcement systems.
""So you could spend up to $150,000 (£103,000) enabling a person to be homeless because you're not providing them with the solution. Or you could invest up to $25,000 (£17,000) and people would be in housing, stable, secure and safe [with] hardly any police interventions or utilisation of emergency rooms. You didn't need to be Warren Buffet to figure out which of those was the better investment.
""More than 1,000 communities got involved from around the United States, and we set the goal that we could end chronic homelessness - the homelessness of the most vulnerable, the most disabled, the most likely to die on the street. We could end that form of homelessness in our country in 10 years.
""We saw in the first five years about a 40% decrease in chronic homelessness around the country. Some cities achieved 67-70% decreases.
""But at this point, right now, I can think of only a couple of cities in the country that have actually ended chronic homelessness. The recession hit; administrations changed. Some of the attention got dissipated. That led to resources being dissipated. You didn't have that same concentration and so you didn't have the same outcomes and results.
Dr Josh Bamberger is the former medical director of housing, San Francisco, and implemented Housing First in the city, providing homes to more than 10,000 homeless people, mainly in an area called the Tenderloin.
""Like every other city in the United States, we had a ten-year plan to end homelessness and, as I'm sure you're aware, homelessness still exists in San Francisco.
""It's disappointing that it doesn't really feel like there's been much shift in the number of people who are lying on the streets in the Tenderloin, which is the inner-city portion of San Francisco, in 15 years.
""The Tenderloin is a densely-populated area. They're small apartments, 300 square feet, sometimes the bathrooms are down the hall. There are probably 1,000 or 1,500 of these buildings with 150 small apartments in them. It's loud, there's a lot of activity going on and there's a lot of drug dealing that goes on in the streets,
""I think if you're struggling with sobriety and people are offering you drugs and alcohol on a regular basis, it's harder to make progress.
""In San Francisco, we are in this very challenging conundrum where the cost to rent an apartment is beyond the means of low-income people. The average cost of a studio apartment in San Francisco is something like $2,500 a month (£1,700) and if you're getting benefits from the government, the most you can make is about $950 (£650) a month, so that's a huge gap that is never going to be overcome.
""We housed the wrong people. When you have such great demand for limited resources, then you need to be very exact and very courageous in only offering housing to the people who need it the most. We used our very limited local resources for people who are just low-income. We didn't focus on the highest users of the healthcare system first.
""What we should have done from the beginning is only offered housing to the 20% of people who are chronically homeless, and then used that opportunity to disclose that the government isn't investing in expanding the affordable housing sector adequately.""
Jamie Rogers ran the Housing First programme in the Canadian city of Medicine Hat, which has eradicated all homelessness, defined as meaning no-one will have to sleep rough for more than 10 days before they have access to stable housing.
""Medicine Hat is in South Eastern Alberta, a community of about 63,000 people. It's a very family-focused community.
""I first heard about Housing First from a trip that I took to Toronto. I have to be really honest: I was probably one of the biggest sceptics that it would actually work.
""Since April 2009, this community has collectively housed 1,013 individuals; 705 adults and 308 children.
""We take an extremely targeted approach to look at those that are in greatest need or closest to death, which typically are those who are chronically homeless, and are living in places that are unfit for human habitation.
""We did not have to build housing per se. We have a very limited number of units strictly for housing the homeless. What we do very well is build relationships with landlords and property management and communities, and use market housing.
""[Initially] landlords were extremely sceptical. They were worried about bed bugs, increased violence and drug dealing, so we worked really hard to present factual information about who we actually serve. And we've seen progress. We have 175 different landlord and property management companies on board with us and we now have landlords calling us.
""If you ended up on the streets of Medicine Hat tonight, you could spend one night in the shelter and be speaking to a worker within three days. And you could be on a wait list for a house as quick as tomorrow.
""Rather than just introducing programmes like Housing First, we have restructured our entire system approach to ending homelessness.
""We take the stance that people are worthy of a home and it is a fundamental human right to have shelter and a roof over one's head. Of course it is recovery-oriented, and we help and support people in making different choices in their life, but we don't withhold housing because of who they choose to be.
""Housing First works. I cannot say it enough: it absolutely works.""
The Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 12:05 GMT. Listen online or download the podcast.","The Housing First approach to homelessness is a model that provides people experiencing homelessness with immediate access to safe and affordable housing, without requiring them to address other issues such as addiction or mental health problems first.

Newport move seven points clear of the drop zone, while Luton drop to 13th.

""We never managed the game very well from that first goal on. We managed the game brilliantly before that, in really difficult conditions for both teams. Up until they scored I thought if anybody would win, it would be us.
""Individual errors are giving us problems at the moment. That's how it is, there's nothing I can do about it now. We can only get back on the training ground but it's hard to irradiate an individual error.
""This is football. You have to get back on the horse. There's no remedy or quick fix. You've got to make the most of your opportunities which we haven't done. These last few games have been bitterly disappointing.""

23,"Earlier this summer, I made a trip back to Benghazi, Libya's second city, ahead of the country's first post-Gaddafi nationwide elections.
There had been a spike of pre-election violence, especially in the east, and many Libyans were accusing a shadowy fundamentalist group that had emerged in the city that spawned the uprising against Col Muammar Gaddafi.
There had been an attack against a vehicle convoy carrying the British ambassador. There was a similar incident involving the UN's envoy to the country and even the Benghazi base of the International Committee of the Red Cross came under fire.
Most strikingly, video had emerged on the internet of a small group of young men desecrating and destroying Allied war graves in Benghazi's two Commonwealth war cemeteries.
Less high-profile incidents had also taken place across the city - among them, a drive-by shooting at a western-style hairdressing salon and anti-democracy protests in the main square.
We tracked down and arranged a meeting with Ansar al-Sharia members in a run-down area of central Benghazi, just off a small park where other men passed the day drinking coffee.
Unfortunately the group had made it clear they were not willing to be interviewed on tape, nor would they speak to female members of our team.
I met about four men in a sparsely furnished room on the fourth floor of a tower block. One middle-aged man, who called himself ""the Sheikh"", did most of the talking while four much younger men sat and listened.
While they seemed to care little for explaining their philosophy or methods to western journalists, they did not deny involvement in anti-democratic stunts.
As for the attacks on Western targets, they said they did not know who the perpetrators were, but alleged that ""Western intelligence agencies"" based in Libya were to blame because they wanted to undermine Sharia, Islamic law.
Did Ansar al-Sharia carry out Libya attack?
In a written statement, the group also told us why they rejected the electoral process then taking place across the country - even though Col Gaddafi, who had like many other Middle Eastern dictators suppressed the activities of Islamist groups, was dead and they were again free to organise.
""Democracy is a human condition where laws are made by people,"" said a brief statement from the Ansar al-Sharia group, on headed notepaper that contained the twin symbols of the Koran and a Kalashnikov rifle.
It went on: ""Only God has the authority to make law and that is why Islam and Sharia are incompatible with democracy.""
I never got the impression from my time in Benghazi or elsewhere in Libya that Ansar al-Sharia, and other extreme Islamist organisations, were large in number or particularly well supported.
Indeed, they were pretty much routed in the elections that returned a moderate Muslim Congress.
But as the terrible events of this week showed in Benghazi, with so many weapons at large in Libya and so much anger to tap into, even small organisations like Ansar al-Sharia could yet undermine the new, democratic Libya and its relationship with its Western supporters.","The article describes the author's trip to Benghazi, Libya ahead of the country's first post-Gaddafi nationwide elections.

People living in 10 houses on the road were ordered to leave last week over fears a landslip could cause the properties to collapse.
But many residents have said they are scared and ""in the dark"" about the future of their homes.
The council said eight of the 10 affected properties have been vacated, with families either moving or having moved into alternative accommodation.

Northern Ireland shaded much of the game and largely snuffed out Wales' attacking threat, but they also lacked a cutting edge in attack.
Wales only managed one shot on target and the game was settled by the one moment of real quality at Parc des Princes.
Northern Ireland's resistance was finally broken when centre-back McAuley turned Gareth Bale's low, whipped cross into his own net.
It means Wales - in their first major tournament finals since the 1958 World Cup - will face Belgium or Hungary in the last eight in Lille on Friday.
Chris Coleman's side were blunted by their dogged opponents, but the scrappy nature of victory and the winning goal will matter little to their jubilant fans.
For Northern Ireland, the manner of defeat was galling, particularly for the 63-cap McAuley, who had scored in the 2-0 group win against Ukraine, which had helped his country reach the round of 16.
Both sides were playing a first match in the knockout stages of a major tournament since 1958, when they reached the World Cup quarter-finals.
Parc des Princes was awash with green and red as fans mingled and revelled in the enormity of the occasion - but the match failed to ignite during a cagey first half.
Northern Ireland's intention to frustrate their opponents was clear, depriving Wales of space with a careful pressing game held together by rigid positional discipline.
They also posed a counter-attacking threat, with one early break leading to a chance for Stuart Dallas, whose shot was saved by Wayne Hennessey.
Having beaten Russia so impressively in their final group game, Wales seemed neutered by Northern Ireland's containing strategy.
Coleman's men had struggled for goals during qualifying - scoring 11 in 10 matches - and this match demonstrated their occasional shortcomings against well-organised defences.
Bale saw one of his trademark dipping free-kicks saved by Michael McGovern but the Real Madrid forward's threat in open play was subdued.
That was until the 75th minute, when he unleashed a fizzing ball across the six-yard box and the sliding McAuley deflected the ball into the net.
This was the first match of the competition in which Bale failed to score, but his major contribution to Wales' winner was yet another example of the 26-year-old's ability to rise to the biggest occasions.
Tempers boiled over as Northern Ireland chased a late equaliser, with manager Michael O'Neill furiously animated on the touchline as he accused Wales of time-wasting.
Ashley Williams and Jonny Williams both received treatment on the pitch after colliding into each other, with the former holding his arm afterwards in a way which he suggested he may have broken or fractured part of it.
There was a heated exchange between O'Neill and Williams, with the Northern Ireland boss later claiming Wales coaches on the bench had told their captain to sit on the pitch to waste time.
The Swansea City centre-back stayed on the field until the final whistle but, with his arm in a sling afterwards, he could be a doubt for Wales' quarter-final on Friday.
Wales manager Chris Coleman on BBC One: ""The good thing about these boys when we're not playing well is that they have spirit. And at times we were hanging on.

""I'd rather be standing here in the quarter-final not playing at our best. We have to give credit to Northern Ireland - they made it very difficult to play against. They were the better team.

In a statement, Walmart said it felt the ""actions were legal and justified"" and that it would pursue other options to defend the company.
A group supporting the employees called the decision a ""huge victory"".
Most of the allegations filed by employees related to protests in 2013, when Walmart workers - backed by labour groups - travelled to the company's headquarters to protest at a shareholder meeting.
Walmart had said the employees were fired due to unexcused absences not protected by labour law.
The judge disagreed and ordered Walmart to compensate the workers for ""loss of earnings and other benefits suffered as a result of the discrimination against them"".
He also ordered Wal-Mart to hold a meeting in 29 stores throughout the country to inform employees of their right to strike, and to promise not to threaten or discipline employees for doing so.
Walmart has faced mounting protests over the last several years targeting its employee pay, the ability of workers to organise into a union and working conditions.

27,"Mr Woolfe was taken to hospital on Thursday after an altercation at the European Parliament in Strasbourg following a meeting of UKIP members.
Fellow UKIP MEP Mike Hookem has tweeted a photo of his ""unbruised"" hands, saying he did not punch Mr Woolfe.
The fracas is being investigated both by the party and the parliament.
Conservative MEP Sajjad Karim will lead the parliamentary probe.
Mr Woolfe collapsed after his exchange with Mr Hookem and was taken to hospital.
He had a precautionary scan which revealed there was no blood clot on his brain. He remains under observation in hospital ""as a precaution"".
The 49-year-old is among the favourites to be the party's next leader following the resignation of Diane James just 18 days after she was elected to the role.
Mr Woolfe's spokesman said on Saturday: ""A team of experts independent of the hospital staff were called in to examine physical injuries to Steven's face, head and body that were inconsistent with just a seizure, or a fall as a result of a seizure.
""The team of experts also examined other pieces of evidence including clothing and images relating to those injuries.
""Their report will shine a different light on claims currently being made in the media.""
Analysis: Where did it all go wrong for UKIP?
In response, Mr Hookem released the photo of his hands, asking: ""Can you see any bruising or abrasions?""
In an interview with BBC Radio Humberside on Friday, Mr Hookem acknowledged the pair had had a ""scuffle"".
But, he added: ""I am innocent. I never threw a punch. I never assaulted him. I will stand my corner.""
There have been varying descriptions of what happened and Mr Hookem has said only that he and Mr Woolfe knew precisely what went on.
Mr Woolfe objected to remarks which he made, he said. ""He then stood up in front of everybody and said 'if it's that, let's take it outside of the room', I think his words were 'mano a mano'.""
""When I walked in he approached me to attack me. He came at me, I defended myself.
""There were no punches thrown, there was no face slapping, there were no digs, there was nothing.""
""It's (what) people in Hull would term 'handbags at dawn'. A bit of a scuffle.""
Mr Woolfe has not spoken in public about the episode, but the Daily Mail quoted him as saying Mr Hookem ""came at me and landed a blow"" after they left the meeting room.
Another UKIP MEP, Nathan Gill, said there had been no police involvement and Mr Woolfe did not want any police involvement.

The BBC has been told he swore in frustration at the situation.
Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said Mr Mitchell should not lose his job over the use of ""inappropriate words"".
Cabinet minister Ken Clarke has also defended Mr Mitchell, who he said was a reasonable and courteous man.
The row broke out on Wednesday after Mr Mitchell was told by officers to get off his bicycle as he left Downing Street and go through the smaller pedestrian gate.
Soon afterwards, the MP for Sutton Coldfield said he did not accept ""that I used any of the words that have been reported"" - but did not go into specific details.
Meanwhile, a friend of Mr Mitchell, quoted by the Sunday Telegraph, says the minister was frustrated by the row, and admits he ""lost it a bit"" but was ""not accusing anyone of lying"".
The friend added: ""He realises there may be differing versions of what was said but he is adamant he did not use the words he is reported to have used.""
Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics programme, Mr Pickles said he believed his cabinet colleague used ""ungentlemanly"" and ""ungallant"" language.
Who says 'pleb' nowadays?
But he added: ""I don't believe somebody should lose public office merely because they used inappropriate words and displayed a bad temper.""
The communities secretary refused to say whether Mr Mitchell should resign if he used the word ""pleb"", but said ""he has never used it in my presence, but I'm proud to be a pleb"".
On Saturday, Mr Clarke, a minister without portfolio in the cabinet, said: ""I have known Andrew for a long time and he is a perfectly reasonable, courteous man with the same high regard for the police services as anyone else.
""He obviously had a flare of bad temper on this occasion and has rightly apologised. I do think this should be allowed to set the matter at rest.""
Yvette Cooper, shadow home secretary, has called for the government to release in full what Mr Mitchell said to the police officers and for an investigation into the incident.
In a letter to Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, Ms Cooper wrote that Mr Mitchell's behaviour was ""completely unacceptable"" and that ""a half-hearted private apology is clearly insufficient"".
""Everyone is already deeply concerned that a senior cabinet minister is reported as dismissing police officers doing an important security job as 'plebs',"" she wrote.
""It is really important that the prime minister does not compound this by dismissing the testimony of police officers and the evidence from their notebooks without proper investigation.""
The Liberal Democrat president, Tim Farron, described Mr Mitchell's alleged outburst as ""utterly, indeed beyond, unacceptable"".
His party leader, Nick Clegg, told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme it was right for Mr Mitchell to apologise, but argued it was time to ""draw a line under it"" unless more information emerged about the incident.
""I think civility and being courteous to the police is important at all times, but it is especially important given the tragic events around the killing of PCs Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes.
""What Andrew Mitchell did was wrong, very wrong.  He knows that and has apologised to the police and explained himself,"" Mr Clegg said.

Her friend, Julie Robinson, escaped with minor injuries.
Bradford Coroner's Court heard the exact details of the crash were unclear due to conflicting witness accounts.
Coroner Martin Fleming said the driver of the Toyota pick-up truck, Natthaphon Klomkhan, told police he was driving at approximately 60kph (37.5mph) when the moped drove from a side road, across a four-lane carriageway, and directly in front of his vehicle.
Mr Klomkhan said he braked, sounded his horn and flashed his lights but was unable to avoid hitting the bike.
Ms Robinson, who did not attend the inquest, said she checked before driving across the road, and claimed the truck was being driven at excessive speeds, and had failed to take evasive action.
In an email sent by Ms Robinson to the coroner in July, she said: ""He just drove straight into the back of the scooter, sending both of us flying through the air at some height.""
Describing the aftermath of the crash, Ms Robinson described blood pouring out of her friend's mouth when her head hit a metal barrier.
She was twice resuscitated at the scene but died later in hospital, the inquest heard.
Mr Fleming said photographs of the scene showed Ms Robinson's view would have been obscured and that crossing the carriageway would have left little margin for error.
He said it was unclear whether the truck driver was going too fast.
The inquest also heard police in Thailand had considered charging Ms Robinson in connection with the incident.

The Bears then replied with 325 to lose by 26 runs in the penultimate over.
Rikki Clarke (76) and Tim Ambrose (68) weighed in with half-centuries, while Keith Barker and Hannon-Dalby gave their side hope at the end with some lusty blows in a 27-run last-wicket stand.

Croft slammed eight sixes and eight fours, while England Test opener Haseeb Hameed also twice cleared the ropes in his 48.
Native Lancastrian Barker came in for unusually rough treatment, his nine overs going for 86, while youngster Aaron Thomason went for 32 off three overs and Hannon-Dalby 77 from eight overs.

34,"Greeks have been enthralled for months by the mystery surrounding the Amphipolis monument.
Now Katerina Peristeri has revealed that fragmentary inscriptions link the tomb to Hephaestion.
Hephaestion died less than a year before the Macedonian leader.
After his death in 325BC, Alexander was said to have ordered that shrines be constructed throughout the empire.
Ms Peristeri's team believe the site at Amphipolis may have been designed by one of two architects, Dinocrates or Stesicrates, and built by Antigonus, another of Alexander's generals.
They also believe that tiny inscriptions found at the site show Hephaestion's monogram (two initials from his name).
However, not everyone was convinced by the team's revelations.
Prof Panayiotis Faklaris of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki told Greek radio on Thursday that there was no indication that the tomb had any connection to Hephaestion or that Alexander had ordered it to be constructed.
There had earlier been speculation that the tomb may be linked to Alexander the Great's mother Olympias or his wife Roxana.
And earlier this year bones were recovered at the site that belonged to at least five individuals, including an elderly woman, a newborn child and two men, one of whom had been stabbed.
As well as 550 fragments of bone, animal as well as human, archaeologists have uncovered three vaulted chambers behind a facade decorated with two big marble sphinxes.
Within the chambers were a pair of caryatids - larger-than-life statues of young women -  and a mosaic pavement depicting the abduction of the goddess Persephone by Hades, king of the underworld.
Alexander, who built an empire from modern Greece to India, was buried in Egypt although the precise location remains a mystery.
As his generals fought over his legacy, his mother, widow, son and half brother were all killed, most of them near Amphipolis.

But he said he would not be resigning as senator until he had legal advice.
Under Australia's constitution, a person cannot run for federal office if they hold dual or plural citizenship.
Earlier this month, two senators from the Australian Greens party were forced to resign for holding dual citizenship.
In a statement posted on Twitter on Tuesday, Mr Canavan said: ""In 2006, my mother lodged documents with the Italian consulate in Brisbane to become an Italian citizen.

The politician - who was born in Australia and says he has never been to Italy - said that ""given uncertainty raised by this matter"" he was resigning as minister.
But he stressed that he was not quitting as senator because he had not yet obtained ""definitive legal advice as to whether my registration as an Italian citizen, without my knowledge or consent, was valid under Italian law"".

Both sides will be called to give evidence to Holyrood's devolution committee on that date.
Mr Swinney and Mr Hands hope a deal can be struck this week.
However, both men have said the onus is on the other to give some ground.
Ahead of the meeting, Mr Swinney said he remained ""committed to reaching an agreement that is in line with the principles of the Smith Commission"".
He said: ""For both parliaments to have adequate time to scrutinise an agreement, it is important that we make progress.""
No deal. No further devolution. Holyrood can't take on extra tax and welfare powers unless there's a fiscal framework to underpin them.
Any framework will include a system to reduce the grant Holyrood gets from the Treasury, to reflect its growing ability to raise its own revenue.
The two sides are struggling to agree the fairest way to achieve that. The Scottish government says the Treasury's current offer would leave it out of pocket. The Treasury disputes that and says SNP ministers can't expect taxpayers in the rest of the UK to underwrite all the risks that come with extra responsibilities.
The Scotland Office minister, Lord Dunlop, says the UK government is ""committed to go the extra mile to get a deal"". But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she ""will not sign up to a deal that's unfair to Scotland"".
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has written to Prime Minister David Cameron calling for him to step in over the matter.
He has said that ""no one is keener"" than he is to reach an agreement, but also warned the Scottish government would have to be ready to ""move towards"" his position.
Despite months of talks, the deadline for agreement was pushed back earlier this month.
On Wednesday, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson proposed a compromise that would see both sides give some ground to agree a shorter-term deal that would be reviewed in five years.
Earlier this week, Mr Hands was criticised for being on holiday with his family while negotiations were taking place.
A Treasury spokeswoman has said the UK government had shown it was willing to compromise and ""go the extra mile"" to secure an agreement.
The two sides differ on key parts of the deal, in particular their interpretation of the ""no detriment"" principle called for by the Smith Commission on further powers for Scotland.
This means neither the Scottish or UK budgets should be left worse off in future by the finalised agreement.
The Scottish government claims the Treasury's latest offer would amount to an ""almost Â£3bn cut"", while Mr Hands insists an offer tabled by Mr Swinney is ""not logical"" and ""not fair"" to taxpayers across the rest of the UK.
The deal proposed by Ms Davidson would see both parties give some ground.
She wants the Scottish government to agree to the UK government's new method of calculating the amount of money it receives each year from the Treasury.

42,"It warns that if someone contracts gonorrhoea, it is now much harder to treat, and in some cases impossible.
The sexually transmitted infection is rapidly developing resistance to antibiotics.
Experts said the situation was ""fairly grim"" with few new drugs on the horizon.
About 78 million people pick up the STI each year and it can cause infertility.
The World Health Organization analysed data from 77 countries which showed gonorrhoea's resistance to antibiotics was widespread.
Dr Teodora Wi, from the WHO, said there had even been three cases - in Japan, France and Spain - where the infection was completely untreatable.
She said: ""Gonorrhoea is a very smart bug, every time you introduce a new class of antibiotics to treat gonorrhoea, the bug becomes resistant.""
Worryingly, the vast majority of gonorrhoea infections are in poor countries where resistance is harder to detect.
""These cases may just be the tip of the iceberg,"" she added.
Gonorrhoea can infect the genitals, rectum and throat, but it is the last that is most concerning health officials.
Dr Wi said antibiotics could lead to bacteria in the back of the throat, including relatives of gonorrhoea, developing resistance.
She said: ""When you use antibiotics to treat infections like a normal sore throat, this mixes with the Neisseria species in your throat and this results in resistance.""
Thrusting gonorrhoea bacteria into this environment through oral sex can lead to super-gonorrhoea.
""In the US, resistance [to an antibiotic] came from men having sex with men because of pharyngeal infection,"" she added.
A decline in condom use, which had soared because of fears of HIV/Aids, is thought to help the infection spread.
The disease is caused by the bacterium called Neisseria gonorrhoea.
The infection is spread by unprotected vaginal, oral and anal sex.
Symptoms can include a thick green or yellow discharge from sexual organs, pain when urinating and bleeding between periods.
However, of those infected, about one in 10 heterosexual men and more than three-quarters of women, and gay men, have no easily recognisable symptoms.
Untreated infection can lead to infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease and can be passed on to a child during pregnancy.
The World Health Organization is calling on countries to monitor the spread of resistant gonorrhoea and to invest in new drugs.
Dr Manica Balasegaram, from the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership, said: ""The situation is fairly grim.
""There are only three drug candidates in the entire drug [development] pipeline and no guarantee any will make it out.""
But ultimately, the WHO said vaccines would be needed to stop gonorrhoea.
Prof Richard Stabler, from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: ""Ever since the introduction of penicillin, hailed as a reliable and quick cure, gonorrhoea has developed resistance to all therapeutic antibiotics.
""In the past 15 years therapy has had to change three times following increasing rates of resistance worldwide.
""We are now at a point where we are using the drugs of last resort, but there are worrying signs as treatment failure due to resistant strains has been documented.""

It's hard to say if more people around the world are having more oral sex than they used to, as there isn't much reliable global data available.
Data from the UK and US show it's very common, and has been for years, including among teenagers.
The UK's first National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles, carried out in 1990-1991, found 69.7% of men and 65.6% of women had given oral sex to, or received it from, a partner of the opposite sex in the previous year.
By the time of the second survey during 1999-2001, this had increased to 77.9% for men and 76.8% for women, but hasn't changed much since.
A national survey in the US, meanwhile, has found about two-thirds of 15-24 year olds have ever had oral sex.
Dr Mark Lawton from the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said people with gonorrhoea in the throat would be unlikely to realise it and thus be more likely to pass it on via oral sex.
He recognises that while condoms would reduce the risk of transmission, many people wouldn't want to use them.
""My message would be to get tested so at least if you've got it you know about it,"" Dr Lawton said.","The document warns that gonorrhoea, a sexually transmitted infection, is rapidly developing resistance to antibiotics, making it harder to treat.

48,"The deal, which shores up Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's one-seat majority in parliament, will see Mr Lieberman appointed defence minister.
Mr Lieberman pledged his commitment to ""responsible, reasonable policy"".
The deal led Moshe Yaalon, a member of Mr Netanyahu's Likud party, to quit as defence minister in protest on Friday.
The former general warned that Israel was being taken over by ""dangerous and extreme elements"".
Mr Lieberman, who has twice served as foreign minister, has a reputation for inflammatory comments and takes a hawkish stance towards the Palestinians.
Avigdor Lieberman is a colourful addition to Israel's ruling coalition.
A Russian-speaking immigrant from the former Soviet Union, he is routinely described in newspaper profiles as a former nightclub bouncer in reference to a brief chapter in his early life.
Mr Lieberman served as foreign minister in the past, where he was generally perceived to cut a sometimes undiplomatic figure. At the defence ministry he will be in charge of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), one of the most revered institutions in Israeli society. Benjamin Netanyahu has emphasised, though, that he will continue to take the lead in matters of national security.
The recruitment of Mr Lieberman and his Yisrael Beitenu party cannot be seen straightforwardly as a sign of a government drifting to the right.
Mr Netanyahu has been desperate to find a way to enlarge his coalition, which previously had a majority of a single vote, and he considered cutting a deal with the left-wing opposition before finally turning to Mr Lieberman.
Profile: Avigdor Lieberman
Since winning a fourth term in office last year, Mr Netanyahu has said he would explore bringing a sixth party into his coalition to widen its majority in parliament.
Wednesday's deal will give the prime minister control of 67 of the 120 seats in the Knesset. He previously had 61, which made it difficult to pass legislation.
Before agreeing to bring in Yisrael Beitenu, Mr Netanyahu had engaged in negotiations with the centre-left Zionist Union, amid international pressure to resume peace talks with the Palestinians.
France recently announced it would host an international conference on 3 June to try to revive the peace process, which collapsed amid acrimony in 2014.
""I am committed to promoting the peace process. I am committed to make every effort to reach an agreement,"" Mr Netanyahu said after signing the coalition deal with Mr Lieberman in Jerusalem.
""I intend to seize those opportunities. A broader government, a more stable government will make it easier to do so,"" he added.
Mr Lieberman, who lives in a Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank, has repeatedly voiced scepticism about pursuing peace with the Palestinians.
At one point he suggested toppling the Palestinian Authority. A few weeks ago he threatened to kill a Hamas leader if the militant Islamist movement did not return the bodies of Israeli soldiers killed in the 2014 war in the Gaza Strip.
But on Wednesday he stated: ""My commitment first of all is to responsible, reasonable policy.""
""All of us have commitments to peace, to the final status agreement, to understanding between us and our neighbours.""
The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, warned that Mr Lieberman's appointment as defence minister would ""result in apartheid, racism and religious and political extremism"".
In a separate development on Wednesday, an Israeli human rights group said it would stop filing complaints against alleged abuses by Israeli soldiers.
B'Tselem said that after 25 years of going through the military's legal channels it had concluded the process was what it called a ""whitewash mechanism"".
The military said B'Tselem's view was biased and failed to reflect reality.","The document discusses a deal between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Avigdor Lieberman, which will see Lieberman appointed as the new defence minister.

Tapachula lies 32km (20 miles) from the border with Guatemala and is an entry point for many migrants fleeing violence and poverty in Central America.
Sgt Lopez has five sisters and five brothers, one of whom is in the Marines. ""I kept trying to get in, but there was never a space for me so I did private security for a while and then joined the police,"" she explains her career choice.  She is the only female member of her family to join the force.
As the sergeant in charge of the patrol she has to prepare all of her kit before setting off. ""I'm part of a police unit that looks after the rights of migrants crossing the border,"" explains Sgt Lopez about her role on border with Guatemala.
Sgt Lopez spends much of her time on patrol in the streets of Tapachula. ""We have many hotels and shelters here which house migrants from places such as El Salvador and Honduras,"" she says.
""We used to have a little place in the square for women who had been trafficked. It's a very common problem in Tapachula. It was a place for them to get legal advice and support, but it closed down. I would really like to do more to help them. At the moment I do a talk in a drop-in centre at the border to warn women about the tactics men use to trick them.""
Although her family lives in the same town, Sgt Lopez has to stay and sleep in the police station for four weeks at a time while on duty.
All the food in the station is prepared by the police officers. They work, live and eat together for the duration of their four-week long shift.
As Sgt Lopez carries on with her patrol, she comes across a young family living in an old railway carriage. The family is from Yucatan in Mexico and are visiting family in Tapachula. They live in the empty carriage because they cannot afford a hotel.
The border between Mexico and Guatemala is a popular crossing point for migrants trying to reach the Unites States. They come from El Salvador, Honduras, Venezuela and some from countries further afield such as Cameroon, Ethiopia and Eritrea.
As Sgt Lopez approaches the river's edge a man carrying a heavy load turns and walks back to the Guatemalan side of the river.
""Some people are afraid of the police. We know that there are bad police officers who often extort money from people bringing goods across the river,"" says Sgt Lopez.
""There used to be a checkpoint nearby so they take this path to avoid it. It's where women have had their goods stolen so we regularly check it.""
Migrants often follow the rail tracks to try and avoid checkpoints along the route.
""It's really hard for migrants as they come to escape from violence and often when they get here they experience the same thing.""
""On my five days off I just get straight into my own clothes and visit my boyfriend. He's cool with me being a police woman."" On her Sundays off Sgt Lopez plays football for the Tapachula women's team.

50,"The move is a response to sanctions put on Russia over the conflict in Ukraine.
BBC News website readers have been in touch regarding the foods they will miss, although many are confident Russia will prosper under the restrictions.
Almaz Nizamutdinov, Ufa, Russia
This will be a stimulus for our farmers to grow more and expand their production of food.
However, they are not able to organise the supply required by the market, so we will probably suffer from a deficit and high prices for some period of time.
I think people will start to grow their own vegetables, apples and animals for meat in their gardens, like back in the Soviet Union when there was nothing to buy in the supermarkets.
Eventually our farmers, with the help of foreign producers, will organise joint production in our country under these restrictions and everything will be OK.
Dmitry Konstantinov, Moscow, Russia, and London, UK
So far, it seems Russian sanctions are smarter than the Western ones.
For the last two decades Russian farmers have been complaining that they cannot hit their Western competitors.
It is quite obvious that Russia is able to produce apples, milk and meat. It does produce these items but Western food is simply cheaper, due to the outdated agricultural technologies Russia uses and the lack of the governmental support to farmers.
Now the latter have a chance of revenge. The only downside for Russia is a slight increase in food prices.
Damien Butters, Moscow, Russia
As a UK citizen who has lived and worked in Moscow for six years I feel it is about time Russia defended itself against the EU, USA and Nato.
There has been a constant flow of anti-Russian propaganda from the UK, US and EU as well as Nato.
I like to eat good food. I go to the local market every Saturday and buy Russian fruit and vegetables.
I don't have to pay for the artificial stuff that comes out of Holland which UK citizens buy. I like Italian meats and French cheese, but if I have to put up with having to buy them on my several trips to Italy a year then so be it.
My bread is less than fifty pence a loaf and very good quality, meat products I only eat rarely so they don't affect me.
Gennady Orlov, Saratov, Russia
I do not see a tragedy in the food embargo when Russia's state interests are at stake.
Even more, the embargo will be beneficial in the long run. It will give an impetus to revive Russia's own food production, will repress corruption connected with the food industry, and will diminish the threat of food overconsumption and related obesity epidemics.
The embargo will enhance Russia's psyche, national ideal, and will boost national pride.
Yuri Alexandrov, St Petersburg, Russia
I'd being living in the UK with my family for quite a while, but we decided to go back to Russia some time ago.
These sanctions mean not much at all. Most day-to-day food can be sourced locally and most of the time we buy locally produced meat and vegetables anyway.
I would probably miss milk products from Finland but it's not the end of the world. We used to have quality milk from local factories.
I really hope those sanctions show to Europe that Russia and Western Europe have much more in common rather than our overseas friend, the US.
Andrey Briouhan, Moscow, Russia
It seems the US and EU food embargo will not have big effect on Russian citizens, maybe some lack of specific kinds of goods.
There will be more reorientation toward customs unions, especially with Belarus. Now Poland can exchange apples for fish with Baltic countries instead.
As for me: I almost do not buy US and EU food. I will miss Czech beer, though, maybe some kind of meat.
Viktoria Ivanova, St Petersburg, Russia
We'll easily survive without fruits and vegetables from the EU. Russian dairy and meat products are better and tasty and cheaper.
We don't buy tasteless cucumbers and tomatoes from Spain and Holland. Vegetables and fruits we can buy from Belarus, Turkey, China, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and non-EU countries.
Dear citizens of Europe, we will survive without your products. Will you survive without Russian money?

Students have been campaigning for the removal of the statue of the 19th Century figure, unveiled in 1934.
Other monuments to colonial-era leaders have also been the target of protest in South Africa.
The BBC's Mohammed Allie told Focus On Africa radio that there was a ""festive atmosphere"" as students, academics, members of political parties and ordinary Cape Town residents came to witness a ""historic moment for South Africa"".
The crowd cheered as the statue was being lifted of its plinth. Once it was removed some students jumped on it and started hitting it with wooden sticks and covering the face with plastic.
At the scene: BBC's Mohammed Allie
When the crane removed the Cecil Rhodes statue, it was a huge victory for black South Africans fed up with a lack of education and job opportunities more than 20 years after apartheid ended.
""We finally got the white man to sit down and listen to us,"" said a student who had campaigned for it to be taken down. Some were chanting ""one settler; one bullet"" - a sign that anger could boil over if the lives of black people do not improve.
There was a mixed crowd watching - with many white academics and students also supporting its removal.
But the whole affair serves as a wake-up call to South Africans to tackle racial inequality. People point to the fact that at the University of Cape Town there are only five black South African-born professors.
Why South Africa should keep the statue
Rhodes - a controversial figure
Five other removed statues
The ""Rhodes Must Fall"" campaign began in March after activist Chumani Maxwele smeared excrement on the statue as a protest against Rhodes' racism and its legacy at UCT.
The protesters said that the statue had ""great symbolic power"" which glorified someone ""who exploited black labour and stole land from indigenous people"".
For the latest news, views and analysis see the BBC Africa Live page.
The campaign led to the university's 30-member council voting on Wednesday for the statue's removal.
The council defended the decision saying it had canvassed the views of students, academic staff, alumni and the public before coming to a conclusion.
""This is exactly how a university should work and we believe is an example to the country in dealing with heritage issues,"" it added.
The campaign has triggered attacks on other statues around the country seen as representing South Africa's racist past.
But it has also led to a backlash with some white South Africans rallying to protect the statues of the 19th Century president Paul Kruger in the capital Pretoria, and 17th Century colonialist Jan van Riebeeck in Cape Town.
Kruger, a contemporary of Rhodes, was an Afrikaner leader known for his opposition to the British in South Africa. Van Riebeeck was a Dutch coloniser who arrived in South Africa on 5 April 1652.
South Africa's leftwing Economic Freedom Fighters party has backed the campaign to remove the statues.
Government officials have condemned the attacks on statues, and say a decision on their future will be taken only after consulting all groups.","The statue of Cecil Rhodes was taken down in front of cheering protesters at the University of Cape Town (UCT) in South Africa.

""It's now becoming second nature to shoppers to reuse their carrier bags and hopefully to think more about our impact on the environment.""
Morrisons, the Co-operative, Waitrose and Boots have all reported an estimated 80% reduction in carrier bag use, with Asda witnessing a drop of 90% and Sainsbury's 100% as it no longer offers them to shoppers.

July-to-September saw Gross Domestic Product rise by 0.1%, the same rate as April-to-June.
Given that the population is growing, the per capita growth was flat, as it was in the previous two quarters.
That is: in the first nine months of last year, there were more of us, but on average, we weren't getting any better off.

Six minutes after the GDP figures were published, an email arrived in my inbox from the SNP group at Westminster.
It flagged up a debate on the economy, in which MPs were going to claim that ""George Osborne is failing on key economic indicators"".
That may be true as well. But we are still unclear what has been going wrong closer to home than the UK Treasury.
The simple answer is: oil and gas. The sharp fall in the oil price has become a further fall, and an expectation of a prolonged low price, perhaps dipping far lower.
The past two days have seen the price flirt with falling through the $30 threshold, and forecasts of $20 per barrel of Brent crude (that was Goldman Sachs), then to $16 (with a very gloomy global outlook from the Royal Bank of Scotland), and even to $10.
It is striking that the talk this time last year, as oil fell in only seven months from $115 to $45, was that there would be a balancing effect from parts of the economy that buy energy rather than produce it.
That would include motorists spending the extra change when filling up the car, and industrial consumers of oil, with enhanced profits.
For Scotland, it doesn't look that way now. Yes, it's been tough for Aberdeen and the north-east. This week, we've seen Scottish new car registrations fall last year, while the UK had record sales - the decline entirely explained by the Grampian effect.
Aberdeen Airport saw passenger numbers last year fall 7%, while Edinburgh and Glasgow saw healthy growth. Hotel occupancy and rates in the north-east have plummeted.
However, we've found also that the offshore sector's supply chain stretches further than some supposed, particularly in engineering, but reaching across many more sectors. And business confidence has barely picked up in the energy-burning sectors.
Part of the explanation for low growth is shared with the rest of the UK, notably in manufacturing.
Exporters have been weighed down by the strength of sterling. And those non-exporters who compete with importers have had the same pressure.
The recent rise in US Fed interest rates has led to sterling weakening against the dollar, which may help those exposed to trade competition.
But there's more going on than that. The statistics from the Scottish government point to problems with the transport and communications sector. In the first nine months of last year, it appeared to contract 2.4%.
Manufacturing contracted 2.3% in the full year. Within that, metals and machinery was down nearly 20% in one year, and 8% in the most recent quarter.
There were better performers over the year, including the category that covers tourism, and moreso in utilities.
Gas and electricity grew in output by 2.3% in the year to July/September, and in water supply and waste services, the number was up 8%.
The star performer has been construction, up 17.3% over the year, though the most recent quarter's figures show the benefit of big public infrastructure projects has begun to weaken.
The Scottish government can take some credit for that construction boom, with roads, rail and a big bridge over the Forth.  Construction fared much less well south of the border.
Such growth was never going to be sustainable under current budget constraints, but it was essential to keeping Scotland out of recession in the middle of last year.
The government statisticians have added some new detail on what has been behind that, with total construction output in the year to the third quarter of 2015 at nearly £12bn.
In the year to the third quarter of 2015, there was a £2.5bn infrastructure spend, rising by 53% on the previous year.
New public housing spend was £469m, according to these calculations, up by 26%. New private homes were at more than three times that level - nearly £1.5bn - but growing at only 3%.
Repair and maintenance of infrastructure was up 20% at £800m, while housing repairs were up 15% at £1.53bn.
That is the best informed guess of the statisticians. But there are question marks over the data. The numbers do not isolate the role of oil and gas in the economy.
And public finance expert John McLaren points out that construction employment has not risen with output in the sector.
He suggests that it might be because workers in that sector are not Scottish-based. In that case, the benefit of employing them is being felt closer to their homes and not in the Scottish economy.
To cover that anomaly, with an increasingly mobile workforce, McLaren suggests we also need to see Gross National Product, or GNP.
That is the figure that accounts for the inflow of income from Scots who work and invest outside the country, as well as the outflow of non-Scottish workers and companies based elsewhere, who take their wages and profits home.
Taking the longer view, McLaren points to transport and communications, which has fallen in output by 10% since 2007, while in the UK, it is up 12%.
The value of output from the tourism industry (or at least hotels and restaurants) is lower than it was in 2007, yet the UK figure is up 8.5%.
The data is patchy in what it captures. And covering a small country rather than the UK, it is bound to be more vulnerable to statistical error.
But using the numbers we have, the sluggish recovery takes on an odd shape when you peer down into the sectors.
And they show the oil price is far from being the only explanation for the under-performance of the Scottish economy.","The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the UK rose by 0.1% in the third quarter of 2015, the same rate as the previous quarter. However, the per capita growth was flat, as it was in the previous two quarters. The Scottish economy grew at a slower rate than the UK, with a 1% increase in GDP in the second and third quarters of 2015, compared to five times as fast as Scotland. The sharp fall in the oil price has become a further fall, and an expectation of a prolonged low price, perhaps dipping far lower. The Scottish government statisticians have added some new detail on what has been behind the slow growth, with total construction output in the year to the third quarter of 2015 at nearly £12bn. However, there are question marks over the data, and public finance expert John McLaren points out that construction employment has not risen with output in the sector. To cover that anomaly, with an increasingly mobile workforce, McLaren suggests we also need to see Gross National Product (GNP), which accounts for the inflow of income from Scots who work and invest outside the country, as well as the outflow of non-Scottish workers and companies based elsewhere, who take their wages and profits home.</s>",mistral7b,XSUM,
58,"It is the first chief executive election since Hong Kong was brought to a standstill by mass pro-democracy rallies in 2014.  Protesters wanted fully democratic elections for their leader - but Beijing refused.
Pro-democracy campaigner Joshua Wong has called the current electoral process ""a selection rather than an election"".
A small group of mainly pro-Beijing electors will choose from three candidates to succeed outgoing leader CY Leung.
His deputy, Carrie Lam, is Beijing's choice for the top job. But her main rival, former finance chief John Tsang, is the public's favourite, according to opinion polls.
The pro-democracy camp are backing Mr Tsang in a likely unsuccessful bid to keep Ms Lam out. The third candidate is retired judge Woo Kwok-hing.
Ordinary Hong Kong people have no say. Instead, Hong Kong's 1,200-seat Election Committee, a mostly pro-Beijing body, will decide on the next leader.
The Legislative Council's 70 members - half of whom are directly elected - form part of this committee. But most of the members are elected by business, professional or special interest groups. Critics say entities that lean towards Beijing are given disproportionately large representation.
In the most recent selection for the Election Committee, pro-democracy activists secured 325 seats on the committee - the highest number ever. However, this does not give them enough seats to control who becomes the next chief executive.
Candidates need 601 votes to win. If no candidate reaches this total, the top two candidates go to a second round.
Incumbent CY Leung limped over the line with 689 votes in 2012 - despite having Beijing's backing. ""689"" then became a pejorative nickname for the unpopular leader - and Beijing will want its choice, Ms Lam, to do much better.
In the nominating round, Carrie Lam secured 580 votes, just shy of the winning mark. Woo Kwok-hing got 180 votes and John Tsang secured 165, just over the qualifying threshold of 150.
Beijing has made it clear that it backs Ms Lam and there are multiple reports of lobbying behind the scenes on her behalf.
John Tsang is seen as the main threat, given the high levels of public support for him. Though pro-establishment, he is seen as the more moderate choice, and more than 300 pro-democracy committee members say they will vote for him. It's the first time the pan-democrat camp has backed an establishment candidate.
Mr Tsang also has support from some pro-establishment voters, but this is unlikely to be enough to defeat Ms Lam.
Carrie Lam has served as Hong Kong's chief secretary - the number two position - for five years and has almost four decades of public service behind her.
She has been praised as a strong administrator but is despised by the pro-democracy camp for backing a mainland ruling saying that while residents could vote for their leader in 2017, they could only choose from a list of pre-approved candidates. She's been nicknamed CY2.0 - another version of the outgoing Mr Leung.
She's also been accused of being out of touch with voters after gaffes including a bizarre search for toilet paper and a failure to use a transport swipe card.
John Tsang is also a career civil servant and Hong Kong's longest-serving financial secretary.
Praised for having a common touch - he's got almost 270,000 Facebook followers - he's called on Hong Kong's divided residents to come together.
But he's been criticised as financial secretary in the past for under spending on social welfare to preserve budget surpluses.
His nickname is ""Pringles"", or ""Uncle Chips"", for his resemblance to a snack mascot.
Mr Woo served as a High Court judge for many years. He is seen as moderate and pro-establishment, and is popular with some activists and young people who feel he is not ""tainted"" by politics. But analysts say Ms Lam and Mr Tsang as seen as the two contenders with a chance of winning.
It seems very unlikely. In 2015 pro-democracy lawmakers rejected Beijing's offer of universal suffrage for the chief executive election if the candidates were pre-approved by the Chinese government, and the proposal was voted down. As a result, this election is being conducted under the existing process.
Carrie Lam advocated on behalf of Beijing's position and has expressed reservations about restarting the political reform process, saying ""We need to ask ourselves very seriously whether we have any prospect of achieving a consensus before we trigger another intense debate in society"".
John Tsang initially expressed similar sentiments but then promised to relaunch the process ""with the greatest determination and courage"". But he says Beijing's framework must be the starting point for any movement.
Regardless of either stance, there has been no sign Beijing is willing to compromise on this. There are also signs it is getting bolder about interventions in Hong Kong, including its lobbying for Ms Lam, its role in blocking two pro-independence lawmakers from the legislature and the recent abduction of a billionaire from a hotel in Hong Kong.
The mass pro-democracy rallies may have ended but many young people remain unhappy.
Joshua Wong, who led the 2014 protests, has refused to back any candidate and will be protesting outside the election venue.
""No one will deny that Carrie Lam is the worst one and a nightmare for us - but it doesn't mean we can put aside our principles and endorse any pro-China candidate,"" he told AFP news agency.
A human rights group is organising a march as the polls take place and Hong Kong police say 1,800 officers will be deployed - more than the total number of electors.
But it is also true to say that during the political ructions of the last three years  - from Occupy protests to the politicised ""fishball"" clashes - there have been Hong Kongers who expressed support for the status quo.","The first chief executive election since 2014 mass protests in Hong Kong is taking place.

Lord Wigley said a ""strong group of Plaid MPs"" would be needed to put Wales on an equal footing with Scotland.

The SNP currently has six MPs at Westminster, but recent opinion polls suggest it could make dramatic gains in May.
Lord Wigley said: ""We already see how a potentially powerful SNP, with Alex Salmond returning to Westminster, is calling the shots and framing the agenda for the next Parliament.
""We wish them well in standing up for the interests of their country, but we in Wales cannot afford to be left behind in this process.""
Responding, SNP election campaign director Angus Robertson told BBC Wales: ""SNP MPs will work with our colleagues in Plaid Cymru to help build a progressive alliance at Westminster that will put forward a fairer alternative to austerity and ensure that neither Scotland or Wales can be ignored at Westminster.""
So what exactly is the relationship between Plaid Cymru and the SNP?
The party's press release says Plaid have to make an extra special effort otherwise all the attention and resources will be diverted to Scotland.
And yet Dafydd Wigley gave me the impression at their conference in Caernarfon earlier this month that there was a far more united approach between the two nationalist parties.
He said then: ""The SNP have said very generously and constructively that they would be quite prepared to put the needs for Wales to get a new funding formula as part of any packages going forward.""

Mr Ellis said he was in prison at the time.
Both men were responding to comments made by Fine Gael TD Alan Farrell.
Mr Stack, chief prison officer at the high-security Portlaoise Prison, was shot in the back of the neck as he left a boxing match in 1983.
He was left paralysed and died 18 months later.
In his statement, Mr Adams said that during Ireland's general election campaign in February, he had emailed Irish police commissioner Noírín O'Sullivan a list of four republicans who may have been involved.
The Sinn Féin leader said he had been given the names by Austin Stack, himself a senior prison officer and son of Brian Stack.
Mr Adams said Austin Stack told him the names were given to him (Mr Stack) by journalists and Garda sources.
But Mr Stack, who with his brother, Oliver, and Mr Adams met a senior republican with knowledge of his father's murder in 2013 in Northern Ireland, denies handing over any names.
At the time of the meeting, the senior republican told the brothers the IRA had not sanctioned the shooting of their father and the person responsible had been disciplined.
In his Dail statement, Mr Adams repeated that he had been given the names by Austin Stack and he denied that he had described the four as suspects.

63,"It said those infected with HIV, or who developed advanced Hepatitis C, should get £27,000 per year - the equivalent of the average Scottish salary.
They are currently offered £15,000.
The Scottish government said it had yet to decide whether to implement the new proposals.
Campaigners have been split over the level of payouts, with some saying more money should be found.
The move follows the publication of the findings of the Penrose Inquiry into the contamination of blood supplies in the 1970s and 80s.
Financial support is targeted at people who were infected by their NHS treatment, including haemophiliacs and people who have had blood transfusions.
Many went on to suffer conditions such as liver disease.
The Department of Health recently estimated the number of victims was 30,000 UK-wide.
Under the Scottish proposals, those who have both infections would receive £37,000 per year, an extra £7,000 on present arrangements.
For the first time, widows or widowers would also be supported by an annual pension.
But victims' groups said many people would still miss out on compensation completely.
Philip Dolan, of the Scottish Infected Blood Forum, said: ""Disappointment is an understatement.
""It's like thirty pieces of silver paid to Judas to betray Jesus.
""These proposals mean that people are only getting what Lord Ross recommended in 2003. They are only getting what they were due 13 years ago.""
Hepatitis C is a virus which damages the liver.
In the early stages most people are unaware they have the infection, and between 15-25% of people will clear the virus from their system naturally.
For the remaining 75-85%, their health will gradually deteriorate.  They may suffer jaundice, drowsiness, and pain.
Drug treatments are effective in just over half of all cases, although new drugs are offering more effective cure rates.
Twenty years after infection, approximately 15% to 20% of the remaining patients will develop cirrhosis or advanced liver disease, which is fatal without a liver transplant.
Those infected with HIV as well as Hepatitis C develop cirrhosis sooner and have a higher risk of death.
He added: ""Eighty per cent of people with Hepatitis C are still ill but are not in the advanced stages of the disease therefore they and their spouses will get nothing. Many of them are people who had blood transfusions.
""I'm glad some people are getting this money but do think it's a failure of government to give recognition to the majority of people who got Hepatitis C from a blood transfusion.""
Lawyer Patrick McGuire, who represents most of the Scottish victims, welcomed the report.
But he said the grading system which differentiates between victims and the symptoms they have needs to be looked at.
Mr McGuire said: ""Until this issue is sorted out, some people with terrible health problems will lose out due to this unfair grading system.
""Another obstacle is that, while this new scheme will give a better standard of living to victims in their daily lives, no progress has been made to compensate people for the monstrous injustice they have suffered in the first place.
""Let us not forget that thousands of Scots, through no fault of their own, have been infected with very serious conditions.
""Many have died, many continue to live lives blighted by pain and uncertainty. It is only right that these people receive settlement for what has been done to them.""
A Scottish government spokesman said an announcement would be made on the new recommendations before World Haemophilia Day next April.","The Scottish government is considering whether to implement new proposals that would offer £27,000 per year in financial support to those infected with HIV or advanced Hepatitis C, the equivalent of the average Scottish salary.

70,"Allegations that a Spaniard was behind the killing were being investigated, Johnny Rodrigues said.
The lion, named Cecil, was shot with a crossbow and rifle, before being beheaded and skinned, he added.
The 13-year-old lion was a major tourist attraction at Zimbabwe's famous Hwange National Park.
Zimbabwe, like many African countries, is battling to curb illegal hunting and poaching which threatens to make some of its wildlife extinct.
Mr Rodrigues, the head of Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force, said the use of a bow and arrow heralded a new trend aimed at avoiding arrest.
""It's more silent. If you want to do anything illegal, that's the way to do it,"" he told BBC's Newsday programme.
However, the lion, which had a distinctive black mane, did not die immediately and was followed for more than 40 hours before it was shot with rifle, Mr Rodrigues said.
The animal had a GPS collar for a research project by UK-based Oxford University, allowing authorities to track its movements.
Mr Rodrigues said Cecil's killing was tragic.
""He never bothered anybody. He was one of the most beautiful animals to look at.""
The lion had been ""baited"" out of the park, a tactic which hunters used to portray their action as legal, Mr Rodrigues said.
Two guides had been arrested and if it was confirmed that the hunter was a Spaniard, ""we will expose him for what he is"", he added.
The six cubs of Cecil will now be killed, as a new male lion in the pride will not allow them to live in order to encourage the lionesses to mate with him.
""That's how it works... it's in the wild; it's nature taking its course,"" Mr Rodrigues said.","The lion Cecil, a major tourist attraction in Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park, was killed and beheaded after being shot with a crossbow and rifle.

77,"After Jodie Broughton's early opening try for Catalans, Benjamin Jullien and Ryan Atkins' scores put Wolves on top, before Richie Myler restored parity.
Atkins and Myler exchanged second-half tries as the Dragons enforced a nervy finish at the Halliwell Jones Stadium.
But Andre Savelio's late score ensured Wire ended their six-game winless run.
Victory was Wolves' seventh consecutive home win over Catalans - who last won at Warrington in 2011 - and saw them leapfrog the French side into ninth in the Super League table.
After a bright start, Brougton crossed inside four minutes after good hands from Iain Thornley, but Luke Walsh's conversion was missed.
But the hosts took the lead when Kurt Gidley did get his extras after Jullien had crashed over, and Atkins dived over to make it 10-4.
Then Myler stepped through to bring the visitors level, but Gidley's kick just before the break gave the hosts a slender half-time lead.
After another two from Gidley, Atkins' second try gave Warrington some breathing space, before Catalans' Myler latched onto his own clever grubber kick to score and set up a tense finish.
Warrington - without suspended full-back Stefan Ratchford - looked nervous in the closing stages but eventually sealed the points when Savelio crashed across the line one just minute from time.
New Catalans Dragons head coach Steve McNamara:
""It was a tough start, not the highest quality of games, but I saw a side that showed a lot more resilience than over the last couple of weeks and managed to stay in the contest.
""I enjoyed being back in the Super League environment. The opportunity came up to coach Catalans and I was really keen to do so, it's a good club and a club with big ambitions and I'm hoping to fulfil those.
""The biggest thing we need to improve is our discipline, not just penalties but in possession as well and the biggest area is in defence - that's an area I will be focusing very hard on.""
Warrington coach Tony Smith:
""It wasn't a spectacular game but our effort was enormous. The game had some tension in it but there was lots of spirit and fight and we removed a lot of our errors, which gave us a chance to compete.
""Our back three of Will Dagger, Kevin Penny and Jack Johnson were error-free and did a fantastic job at the back, with us being without our usual three starters.
""Catalans were trying to impress a new coach and they tried really hard and a lot better than they have been in recent weeks and really had a shot at it.

He said that it could have an adverse impact on teacher recruitment.
Sir Mike said no-one in his department was now allowed to use the phrase.
The so-called Trojan horse inquiries followed the sending of an anonymous letter claiming that there was a conspiracy among a group of Muslim parents, teachers and governors to wrest control of several schools in the city.
It gave its name to a long-running and high-profile scandal, which became a major issue for the education secretary and the leader of Ofsted.
The authenticity of the letter has never been established, but Sir Mike said he believes it accurately reflected events that had taken place in schools.
Speaking at the Global Education and Skills Forum, Sir Mike said that staff who opposed such ""infiltration"" were ""targeted, bullied and harassed until they resigned"".
The letter prompted a series of investigations by the Department for Education, Ofsted and the local authority.
In the wake of these inquiries, the need for schools to promote ""British values"" was introduced and Sir Mike's current role, overseeing schools in the city, was created.
But Sir Mike, a former Ofsted chief inspector, said that the term Trojan Horse was now no longer acceptable and was seen as damaging the image of the city's schools.
The claims had only related to 21 out of more than 430 schools in Birmingham.
Although believing that there had been co-ordinated attempts to change the character of schools, he said the investigations had found no evidence of extremism or that any young person had been radicalised.
The problems facing Birmingham's schools could happen in other cities, he said.
""The events were unprecedented but not impossible to happen elsewhere,"" he said.
Sir Mike said that in response to the controversy there had been improvements to whistleblowing arrangements and staff training and greater scrutiny of the role of governors.

The first match of the series begins in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday at 07:00 BST.
""This is the most difficult by a country mile because of the conditions and because of the inexperience of spin that England have got,"" said Vaughan.
""I wonder if England have missed a trick with their preparation.""
England beat Australia 3-2 in this summer's Ashes series, and visit South Africa for a four-Test series in December and January, but Vaughan says the UAE tour ""tops the bill"".
England lost 3-0 when they last faced Pakistan in the UAE in 2012, when their batsmen repeatedly struggled on the slow, spin-friendly pitches.
Pakistan have not lost any of the seven Test series they have played in the UAE since 2010, and Vaughan feels England's two two-day warm-up matches were inadequate preparation.
""I do worry that England haven't had competitive games going into this series in such a challenging place,"" he said.
""Have they had enough time in the middle to go out and produce a big score in the first innings on Tuesday? Could they have come a bit earlier? I would question that.""
Vaughan added the ""roasting"" temperatures were ""as hot as I've ever felt on an England tour"".

England captain Alastair Cook will be partnered at the top of the order for the first Test by all-rounder Moeen Ali - his seventh opening partner since the retirement of Andrew Strauss in August 2012.
Moeen has never batted higher than number six for England, but Cook said his promotion was ""not at all"" a short-term measure.
""Every time he plays he's got an amazing ability to contribute,"" he said.
""We've struggled over the last two or three years for a guy to make that spot his own, so we've given him the opportunity. If he bangs out three hundreds he'll be there as long as he wants to. ""
Vaughan says promoting Moeen is a ""risk"", but one England have to take.
""I can understand people saying he's not the answer, he's a short-term fix, but I think that's where England are at,"" Vaughan said.
""For this tour - and I think you have to categorise this tour completely separately to what South Africa is going to be - playing Moeen at the top of the order gives England six bowling options.""
Former England opener Geoffrey Boycott thinks Moeen is not defensively sound enough to be a Test opener.
He said: ""I think it's a stop-gap decision because they can't seem to find an opening batsman to partner Cook and they're not sure what to do.
""He takes chances, he may come off, he may not. But he doesn't seem to have a tight enough defence for me to make a success of it .
""He'll have the odd innings when he plays well, but he'll have some more when he gets himself out.""
Fast bowler Steven Finn will not be among England's bowling options for the first Test after he was ruled out with a stress injury to his foot.
Finn took 4-16 in the second warm-up match against Pakistan A, and Cook said he ""had every chance"" of being named in the Test team before getting injured.
""He was probably our most impressive bowler in the warm-up games,"" Cook added.
Finn's injury means James Anderson is certain to play but Vaughan says the Lancashire player must prove he can adapt to the conditions.
""Jimmy Anderson has got all the expertise,"" he said.
""But over the last year or so when Pakistan have played here, conventional swing has not been that effective - it has come down to pace and spin.""
Cook also said 27-year-old Yorkshire leg-spinner Adil Rashid - who took 0-55 and 3-53 in the warm-up matches - will make his debut.
""Adil has played major roles for Yorkshire over the last two or three years - he's taken a lot of wickets and scored a lot of runs,"" he said.
""He's bowled really well on this trip and we're really excited to see how he goes.""
Number three batsman Ian Bell and wicketkeeper Jos Buttler look set to play in the first Test, but both are under pressure after a run of low scores.
Bell, who made 19 and 53 in England's warm-up matches, has gone 17 innings without a century and is averaging just 24.29 this year.
Buttler has not passed 50 in his past eight Test innings and made a total of 41 runs in three innings during the warm-up games.
""Ian Bell has got to start scoring runs at number three,"" Vaughan said. ""We're kind of papering over the number three position. England need him. He's got to be the leading light.
""Buttler is a wonderful talent - we've seen that in one-day cricket, T20 cricket, we've seen it briefly in Test match cricket. But we haven't seen it consistently.
""England are very loyal with him, he's a real good team man. But he has to produce. It's time to stamp his mark. If he doesn't and he struggles, questions will be asked.""
Boycott says Buttler's form should be of real concern to England.
He added: ""The lad has enormous talent. But he's just playing poor shots, poor thinking shots. Sweeping straight away with the spinners and that's fraught with danger. I think its tiredness. It's a question mark.""
Pakistan leg-spinner Yasir Shah is doubtful for the first Test after he suffered a back spasm in training.
""We are hoping that he will be fine,"" Pakistan skipper Misbah ul-Haq said. ""That would be a big blow for us - he is the key player.""
Left-arm spinner Zafar Gohar - who took a total of five wickets for Pakistan A in the two warm-up matches against England - has been called up as cover.
England fans may not be familiar with the name, but if he plays, Yasir could pose one of the biggest threats to a batting line-up hardly renowned for its ability to play spin.
He bears more than a passing resemblance to Argentina and Barcelona forward Lionel Messi and bowls with an action modelled on his idol, legendary Australia spinner Shane Warne.
Although he did not make his Test debut until October 2014 at the age of 28, Yasir has enjoyed a remarkable first year at the top.
He became the quickest Pakistan bowler to 50 wickets - in only nine Tests (Warne needed 14) - and his tally of 61 at an average of 24.81 has taken him to fourth in the International Cricket Council rankings.
Given that 48 of England's 60 wickets fell to spin on their most recent Test series against Pakistan in the UAE, expect Yasir to play a prominent role in the coming weeks.
Meanwhile, batsman Azhar Ali is set to miss the first Test after failing to recover from a foot injury sustained during a pilgrimage to Mecca earlier this year.
Pakistan have not played a Test in their own country since terrorists attacked the Sri Lanka team bus in 2009.
However, they have won three and drawn four of their seven Test series since relocating their home matches to the UAE, which includes a 3-0 mauling of England in 2012.
Misbah has suggested England's current team ""may appear weaker"" than that side - a claim rejected by Anderson.
England were bowled out for fewer than 200 runs in four of their six innings, most memorably when collapsing to 72 all out in pursuit of 145 to win the second Test.

McIlroy bogeyed five of his first six holes and needed to hole a 20-foot putt on eight to avoid another dropped shot.
But McIlroy, 28, had four birdies on his back nine as he came home in 32.
The 2014 champion, who has missed the cut in three of his last four events, is six behind US trio Jordan Spieth, Brooks Koepka and Matt Kuchar.
World number four McIlroy was fortunate to only bogey the opening hole as he holed a 25-foot putt from just off the green after a wild second shot had put him in trouble.
Further missed greens saw the Northern Irishman drop further shots at the third and fourth and a four-foot par putt failed to drop at the next after an indifferent approach.
A horrible horseshoe out of the hole left him five over after six and he needed an up-and-down from a bunker to par the short seventh before rescuing par again at the eighth after another errant tee shot.
However, McIlroy was much improved on his back nine as a fine approach to six feet set up a birdie at the 11th after getting a good bounce to avoid a bunker from his tee shot.
As he finally began to find the fairway off the tee, McIlroy birdied the two par fives, the 15th and 17th, while a brave six-foot par putt at the 16th helped to maintain his back-nine improvement.
McIlroy went close with his eagle attempt on the 15th from 30 feet and left his putt short on 17 before rolling in a 15-foot birdie chance at the last.
After his stunning back nine, McIlroy is convinced that he remains in position to challenge for the fifth major win of his career.
""I don't think tomorrow is going to be good at all (weather wise) but we might get the better of it maybe (in the morning),"" the Holywood man told Sky Sports.
""If I can go out there tomorrow and try and keep these good feelings I have (after today), I feel like I am still right in this golf tournament.""
McIlroy, who will tee off at 9:47 BST on Friday morning with Dustin Johnston and Charl Schwartzel, said caddie JP Fitzgerald had played a big role in keeping his spirits up after his horrible start.
""I didn't know where I was after six holes. JP tried to keep me as positive as I could be out there.""
The former world number one acknowledged that his 20-foot putt for par at the par-five eighth had been ""huge"".
""Getting up and down from about 95 yards to get a par there was big - especially on the eighth which was probably one of the easiest holes.
""From the seventh hole on, I had to have 100% trust in myself and not be in two minds what I was doing, which was what I did on the first six holes.""
2011 winner Darren Clarke finished well with birdies at the 17th and 18th but his 75 left him facing a huge task to make his first cut since last year's Open.
After four opening pars, Clarke, 48, had three straight bogeys and he carded two more bogeys and a double bogey.
""I hit the ball nicely but didn't putt very well,"" said Clarke after his round.
Two-time Open winner Padraig Harrington carded a 73 while Offaly man Shane Lowry was one better.
Harrington, champion when the major was last played at Royal Birkdale in 2008, failed to card a birdie as he dropped a shot on the seventh and then double bogeyed the 11th.
Twice major winner Spieth didn't drop a shot in his 65 and was later joined on five under by US Open champion Koepka and world number 18 Kuchar.","2014 champion Rory McIlroy struggled on the front nine of the second round of the British Open, dropping shots and needing to hole a 20-foot putt on the eighth to avoid another bogey.

The home was closed six months ago after Panorama filmed abuse of patients with learning disabilities.
The NHS said the claims about the report's contents were ""misleading"".
""It is premature to speculate on the findings of the NHS review which has not been finalised,"" a statement said.
The report is expected to raise concerns about the lack of detail in any contracts between primary care trusts and Castlebeck.
According to BBC West health correspondent Matthew Hill, the report said the contracts had no built-in mechanisms to say how quality could be assured.
Owner Castlebeck said it was ""committed to learning lessons"".
""We haven't had the opportunity to see the report at this stage so are not aware of its content.""
They added they would be ""acting on those lessons to make improvements to services wherever they are needed"".
The programme showed patients at Winterbourne View being pinned down, slapped and taunted.
The report by the NHS will feed into the ongoing serious case review, which is being conducted by South Gloucestershire Council.
That is expected to be published in the New Year.
Thirteen people have been arrested and released on bail until 28 November in connection with the alleged abuse, pending further inquiries.
Winterbourne View's 24 patients were transferred from the hospital when it was closed, in June.
The report is also expected to raise concerns that families were unable to freely visit their relatives, and were restricted to seeing them in the reception area.
Steve Sollars, whose 22-year-old son Sam was in Winterbourne View for two years up to 2010, said he felt what was happening at the home was being ""hidden"".
""At first they were fine they were good. They would let us go onto the floor where he was and I'd get to know other patients there.

The programme showed patients being pinned down, slapped and taunted. Families were unable to freely visit their relatives and were restricted to seeing them in the reception area. Steve Sollars, whose son was in Winterbourne View, felt that what was happening at the home was being hidden. Since Sam has moved, he has improved significantly.</s>",mistral7b,XSUM,

It comes after the force refused to release the names on privacy grounds, in response to a freedom-of-information request from the Birmingham Mail.
They include crimes such as murder, attempted murder and rape.
Responding to the Mail's request, the force originally said the information was being withheld as it ""would breach the third party's data protection rights"".
It went on to say: ""It would be unfair to release this information where any person could be identified from the data and in this case the right to privacy outweighs any public interest in release.""
Birmingham MP Khalid Mahmood, told the Birmingham Mail the decision was ""absolutely bizzare"".
Now Mr Thompson has told the BBC ""we got this one wrong"" and looked ""silly"", although there were some circumstances when information should not be provided through such requests.
One suspect has since been named by the force - Luke Anderson, 33, is wanted in connection with an attempted murder in 2001.
West Midlands Police said two of the other nine suspects were believed to have died outside the UK, while there were ""ongoing active investigations"" into two others wanted for murder who are believed to be abroad.
In one historical child sex offence investigation, police said the Crown Prosecution Service had decided not to take action against an 81-year-old wanted in collection with an allegation made in 2010.
""We have to strike this balance with people who are wanted and not convicted, when people are charged with offences, clearly we name them as part of a policy and that goes through the courts, it's about transparent justice,"" Mr Thompson said.
""I just think in this case actually there's probably some things we should have done with that information that would have made us look perhaps a little bit more sensible.

85,"The company had attempted to challenge the search warrant on the basis that the information was stored exclusively on computer servers outside the US.
Microsoft previously said it planned to offer business and government clients control over where their data resided.
This followed concerns about data privacy raised by whistleblower Edward Snowden's leaks about US spying.
But the ruling potentially undermines that pledge.
The judge said warrants for online data were different to other warrants.
The search warrant, which was issued to Microsoft by US authorities, sought information associated with a member of the public's email account including their name, credit card details and contents of all messages.
Microsoft said it would continue to oppose the release of the Dublin-stored data.
""This is the first step toward getting this issue in front of courts that have the authority to correct the government's longstanding views on the application of search warrants to content stored digitally outside the United States,"" it said.
Judge James Francis in New York said that this was true for ""traditional"" warrants but not for those seeking online content, which are governed by federal law under the Stored Communications Act.
He said the warrant should be treated more like a subpoena for documents. Anyone issued with a subpoena by the US must provide the information sought, no matter where it was held, he said.
Law enforcement efforts would be seriously impeded and the burden on the government would be substantial if they had to co-ordinate with foreign governments to obtain this sort of information from internet service providers such as Microsoft and Google, Judge Francis said.
In a blog post, Microsoft's deputy general counsel, David Howard, said: ""A US prosecutor cannot obtain a US warrant to search someone's home located in another country, just as another country's prosecutor cannot obtain a court order in her home country to conduct a search in the United States.
""We think the same rules should apply in the online world, but the government disagrees.""
A new data-protection law, currently being drafted by the European Union, aims to make sure companies no longer share European citizens' data with authorities of another country, unless explicitly allowed by EU law or an international treaty.
In response to the ruling in the US, Mina Andreeva, European Commission spokeswoman for justice, fundamental rights and citizenship, told the BBC: ""The commission's position is that this data should not be directly accessed by or transferred to US law enforcement authorities outside formal channels of co-operation, such as the mutual legal assistance agreements or sectoral EU-US agreements authorising such transfers.
""Access by other means should be excluded, unless it takes place in clearly defined, exceptional and judicially reviewable situations.""
Ms Andreeva also said that ""the European Parliament reinforced the principle that companies operating on the European market need to respect the European data protection rules - even if they are located in the US.""
Earlier this year German Chancellor Angela Merkel proposed building up a European communications network to help improve data protection and avoid emails and other data automatically passing through the United States.
Both of these actions were prompted by allegations of mass surveillance by the US National Security Agency.
Microsoft is hoping for a review of the decision from a federal district judge.","A US judge has ruled that Microsoft must hand over data stored on its servers in Ireland to US authorities, despite the company's efforts to challenge the search warrant on the basis that the information was stored exclusively outside the US.

Stokes was jailed for a year after lying to police about how long he had been in the house.
The 49-year-old, of  St Giles' Road, Willenhall admitted perverting the course of justice at Wolverhampton Crown Court.
Police were called to the house where they found Mr Evans lying slumped against a chest of drawers.
A post mortem revealed he died of stab injuries to the stomach and back.

He said: ""Glyn was well liked in the local community and I'd like to thank those local people who came forward to assist in this investigation.

In wet conditions in Yokohama he veered into the railings on his bike when trying to avoid a rider who had fallen in front of him.
Rather than concede his race was over, Brownlee ran barefoot for the final half-lap of the cycling discipline - about a mile - carrying his bike.
The 27-year-old eventually finished six minutes 56 seconds behind the winner.
""It was going quite well - the swim went really well,"" he said.
""On that course you want to stay high up in the field to avoid crashes. I was sitting in fourth to avoid crashes, but then an athlete just crashed in front of me.

96,"The deal would see David Blitzer and Josh Harris, who co-own NHL and NBA franchises, take minority stakes in Palace.
Co-chairman Steve Parish said he was ""really hopeful we can get it done"".
Improvements to the club's Selhurst Park home will be the priority, with Parish retaining day-to-day control.
Blitzer and Harris, who co-own the New Jersey Devils of the NHL and the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers, are expected to take equal 18% shareholdings with Parish, who helped rescue the south London club from bankruptcy in 2010.
His partners in that deal - fellow Palace fans Stephen Browett, Jeremy Hosking and Martin Long - will see their current 25% stakes diluted to 15.33%.
Speaking to BBC Sport in New York, Parish said: ""I think this club can be massive and it's a great opportunity.
""I want to move fast and to do that you need big funds. I'm prepared to do my bit, the three boys who are involved with me are prepared to do their bit.
""But we need to bring some new people in to accelerate it and make sure we've got everything we need. If I was a Palace fan, and I am, I'd be fantastically excited about the future.""
Parish, who made his money in advertising, was speaking at Blazercon, a two-day football convention set up by Roger Bennett and Michael Davies, the two British ex-pats behind the hugely popular Men in Blazers football podcast and NBC TV show.
Conversations with Blitzer and billionaire Harris, who have made their fortunes from investment banking, have been going on for over a year, and the two have spent what Parish described as ""a lot of time"" getting to know the club.
Harris has often spoken of his growing interest in football, particularly the Premier League, which is booming in popularity in North America.
Parish said the new investment would enable the club to tackle a chronic lack of investment in Palace's facilities over the last 25 years, without ""diverting funds from the team"".
Most pressing for Parish is the need to redevelop the Main Stand at Selhurst Park, but he also wants to improve the Arthur Wait Stand and the Whitehorse Lane End, as well as upgrade the club's training ground and scouting network. There are long-term plans to build a hotel and shops at Selhurst Park.
The cost of the building work on the ground alone ranges from a reported £50m to £150m.
But having rescued the club from years of mismanagement, gained promotion to the Premier League and consolidated its position, Parish is determined to take advantage of Palace's status as south London's only top-flight club.
""If this deal doesn't happen the team will be fine,"" said Parish, who attended a 76ers game with Harris on Monday.
""But I really want to see the club fulfil the potential it should have fulfilled. We've had our share of bad luck: it's time we put the record straight.""
Part of the strategy will be to further exploit the burgeoning US market.
""The world began here in football three years ago, so to everybody here we're just a Premier League club - we've managed to erase the rest of our history,"" Parish joked.
""There is a real buzz about soccer, football, in the US and we need to capitalise on it. So we'll be back and forth here as much as we can trying to grab our fair share of support.""","Palace co-chairman Steve Parish is in talks with David Blitzer and Josh Harris, co-owners of NHL and NBA franchises, to take minority stakes in the club.

98,"They fear the changes ""signal a retreat"" in government plans to move towards localised renewable energy.
This week, the High Court ruled that a plan to halve subsidies for solar panels was ""legally flawed"", and MPs' committees said it was ""panicky"".
The church and the charity want a UK target for community energy.
Both organisations have tried to take a leadership role in developing community energy schemes.
They believe this type of project is being unfairly penalised by proposed changes to the feed-in tariff (FiT), the scheme that pays householders and communities a subsidy for producing solar electricity.
Their letter, to Climate Change Minister Greg Barker, is also signed by think-tank Forum for the Future and charitable consultants Carbon Leapfrog.
""I don't think anyone could argue with the fact that the way FiTs were set up created a bit of a market bubble, and economies had to be made,"" said Patrick Begg, the National Trust's director of rural enterprises.
""But the way the government has chosen to change the models has really shaken confidence - and it's very difficult to be certain that when commitments are made about support for renewables, they're going to stick,"" he told BBC News.
The letter contrasts the ""sudden lurches"" in policy and support that the UK has seen with the long-term stability that underpins the success of community-scale solar electricity in Germany.
""Twenty years of solid support has led to 18% of [Germany's] national energy supply now coming from renewable sources, with 45% of schemes owned by co-operatives and farmers,"" it reads.
""In the UK, this is just 1.5%.""
The organisations are urging the government to establish and maintain higher FiTs for community schemes.
The National Trust has about 150 renewable energy projects across the properties it owns, and has set a target of supplying half of its energy needs through renewables by 2020.
It is particularly concerned that in villages it owns, where communities have come together on insulation projects, enthusiasm for extending into solar power has rapidly waned.
The Church of England, meanwhile, says that about 300 churches have so far invested in solar energy, many spurred by the FiTs.
""It's not always straightforward, but a lot of churches thought it was a good opportunity to get involved, to be a good example to the local community,"" said David Shreeve, environmental adviser to the CoE's Archbishops' Council.
""The changes could affect the financial implications for churches going ahead.""
The extent of support for household and community FiTs is currently unclear, with the government having said it would challenge Wednesday's High Court ruling.
It was planning to drop the subsidy from 43p per kilowatt-hour (kWh) to 21p from 12 December. The cut will probably come, but at a later date.
A consultation on other changes closes today.
Among other things, it proposes toughening the criteria on home insulation necessary to qualify for FiTs - a move that was described on Thursday, in a joint report from the Environmental Audit Committee and the Energy and Climate Change Committee, as likely to deal a ""fatal blow"" to the UK's domestic solar power industry.
Meanwhile, a report from consultants Cambridge Modelling predicts that the changes to FiTs mean it will take longer for solar systems to become competitive with electricity supplied from the national grid.
""In the absence of the changes, small solar photovoltaic installations are set to achieve grid parity by 2019,"" said Mark Hughes, the organisation's director.
""The changes to the scheme will delay grid parity and extend the need for feed-in tariff support by approximately three years.""
Critics have said the cut in solar power support undermines the coalition's claim to be the ""greenest ever government"".
Mr Begg agreed that it does raise the question.
""The government set out quite a good agenda; and this kind of thing does start to shake our confidence that they are going to make good on their agenda,"" he said.
In a recent YouGov opinion survey, solar emerged as the UK's most popular energy technology, with 74% of respondents wanting the government to increase the amount in use.
The figure for wind was 56%. Only 16% wanted the use of coal to increase, while 43% preferred a reduction.

100,"Bernhard Langer won the Senior Open at the Royal Porthcawl on Sunday - the German's 87th professional title but the first major to be staged in Wales.
And after a weekend of lavish praise from the players and 43,503 spectators, the Royal Porthcawl is being tipped to host golf's blue riband event, the Open.
The course has made a bid to the Royal & Ancient, golf's world governing body, to be added to its roster of Open venues, alongside illustrious locations such as St Andrews.
It was just one great hole after another and one great green complex after another. I really fell in love with it immediately
The Royal Porthcawl would need to satisfy a number of logistical and infrastructure requirements but, as far as the course is concerned, opinion is overwhelmingly positive.
Chief among the advocates is the great Tom Watson, who is convinced this 119-year-old course should host the Open.
""I talked to [R&A chief executive] Peter Dawson about the Open being played here and said that, in my opinion, it would be a great course for that,"" said Watson.
""I played my first practice round on Monday and, from the first hole on, it was just one great hole after another and one great green complex after another. I really fell in love with it immediately. It's a great golf course.""
A five-time winner of the Open Championship, Watson is as sound a judge of a links course as anyone.
And there is no doubting the authenticity of his affection for the Royal Porthcawl.
It is not as if the American was turning on the charm to win over the locals - his mere presence was enough to do that, his effortless gravitas a magnetic pull for spectators around the course.
Watson was the main attraction of a stellar group on the opening two days of the Senior Open, playing alongside Colin Montgomerie and Fred Couples.
Although Ryder Cup great Montgomerie and former Masters champion Couples drew a significant following, their popularity paled in comparison to the reverence which met Watson at every tee and green.
Cool and courteous, Watson embodies the statesmanlike grandeur of a bygone era when he, Jack Nicklaus and others dominated golf with a ruthless professionalism but a gentlemanly sense of fairness and class too.
It is his standing in the game which gave his endorsement of the course such credence, and he was not the only notable name praising the Royal Porthcawl.
""I think it's a very underrated and underplayed golf course,"" said Montgomerie, who captained Europe to a Ryder Cup victory over the United States at Newport's Celtic Manor in 2010.
""The first five holes are particularly tricky, the eighth hole is a particularly good hole, while the 15th is a super par-three.""
The difficulty of the course is one of its strongest selling points, with Watson and Langer among those to declare Royal Porthcawl a tougher proposition than Hoylake, which hosted the 2013 Open.
Wales is the only one of the home nations never to have staged the Open, though the events of the last week could help end that barren run.
Even before the leading lights of the Senior Open offered their support, there had already been political backing for a bid to host the Open at Porthcawl.
First Minister Carwyn Jones cited the 2010 Ryder Cup as proof of Wales' ability to stage major competitions.
""We have already proven that Wales can host top quality, international golf events,"" Jones said, at the launch of the Senior Open in 2013.
""We have the facilities, the venues, the infrastructure and, most importantly, the welcome that all add up to us being a great host country.""
While the course is generally perceived to be ready for the rigours of an Open, the consensus seems to be that the infrastructure around the Royal Porthcawl requires work.
Roads leading to the course are narrow and residential, while local public transport could struggle to cater for the huge crowds that Open championships attract.
Support in the form of grants and sponsorship could improve the surrounding infrastructure but, even if the R&A gives its blessing, it could be a decade or so before the Royal Porthcawl is added to the Open roster.
It has the history befitting an Open venue, having hosted a number of European Tour events as well as the Walker Cup in 1995, when a 19-year-old Tiger Woods was a part of the United States team which lost to Great Britain and Ireland.
Woods may not relish a return to Wales, having also tasted defeat with the United States in the 2010 Ryder Cup at the Celtic Manor.
But if his fellow giants of the game - Watson et al - are granted their wish, golf's leading figures could one day be playing at the Royal Porthcawl on a regular basis.","The Senior Open at the Royal Porthcawl in Wales has been won by Bernhard Langer, marking his 87th professional title and the first major tournament to be held in Wales.

102,"Although only residents of Scotland can decide the outcome of the referendum, a ""Yes"" vote will mean changes for the whole of the UK - and one of the greatest will be to do with the physical size of the country itself.
So an already busy country would suddenly become much more crowded, statistically at least.
Economy
Scotland contributes some Â£106.3bn of goods and services in ""Gross Value Added"" (GVA) - the key measure by which the Office for National Statistics records regional economic output in the UK.
The UK's total GVA, which was some Â£1,383bn in 2012, according to ONS figures.
The effect of Scotland - and its population - leaving the UK would be a small increase in GDP per head of some Â£117.
The value of Scotland's exports to the rest of the world, excluding that to other UK nations, accounted for some 7% of the UK total in 2012.
Scotland's 59 seats in Westminster would disappear if the country votes ""Yes"" in September, and this could have a drastic impact on future governments.
Modelling the result of the 2010 general election minus Scotland's 59 Westminster seats would have seen David Cameron secure a modest but workable majority of 21. Labour would lose their 41 seats north of the border, while the Lib Dems would drop by 11.
In this alternate 2010 universe, the House of Commons would have looked like something like this.
Life expectancy
Scotland has long suffered lower life-expectancy rates than other parts of the UK, with social problems and pockets of severe poverty cited as factors.
Current UK figures show that men can expect to reach 78.7 years and women 82.6 years.
But if Scotland left the effect would only be a small statistical shift, with men gaining a potential extra 0.4 years (4.8 months) and women 0.3 years (3.6 months).
By comparison with the EU; life expectancy for men is highest in Sweden, where men can expect to reach 79.9 years, while women live longest in Spain (85.1 years).

103,"Walker, 23, has been replaced by Gloucester back-row Ross Moriarty.
But because Walker has been released before the tournament's start, he could be recalled as injury cover later.
""He knows the door is not closed fully yet and there may be an opportunity later in the tournament,"" said Wales head coach Gatland.
The World Cup officially starts on Wednesday, 16 September.
Any players who are replaced because of injury after that date cannot return during the tournament.

104,"Why has Michael Gove decided to shelve plans for the EBC?
The planned introduction of the EBC faced widespread criticism from teachers, heads, MPs and England's exams regulator, Ofqual.
The day after the reform package was announced, the head of Ofqual wrote to Mr Gove warning that introducing too much change at one time might mean the regulator could not guarantee the quality of the exams.
Last month the Commons Education Select Committee issued a damning report into the plans, which it described as a ""red light"" warning over the changes. It simply said there were too many worries for the move to go ahead as planned and changing ""too much, too fast"" could threaten exam quality.
Head teachers and teachers said the removal of coursework could severely disadvantage some students, who tended not to fare so well in exams. There were also concerns about the intention to have one exam for all ability ranges.
There has been intense speculation that the Liberal Democrats in the government had been key in the downfall of the EBC, but an official statement said the changes were a ""coalition policy"", rather than a ""major policy victory"" for their party.
But Mr Gove told the Commons it was his plan to introduce a single exam board for each subject, to avoid what had been described as a race to the bottom, that had prompted him to withdraw his plans.
What was the English Baccalaureate Certificate set to be?
English Baccalaureate Certificates (EBC) were billed as tougher rigorous qualifications to be phased in as replacements for GCSEs. Candidates would take all their exams at the end of their two-year courses. And there was to be very little, if any, coursework.
This is very different to the modular GCSEs, in which candidates sit bite-size chunks as they progress along the course. However, changes unpicking the modular nature of existing GCSEs and introducing more exams at the end of courses are already well under way.
EBCs were to be phased in for candidates starting courses from September 2015, initially in maths, English and science, but then expanding to the humanities at a later date. Regular GCSEs were to continue at the same time in England.
Mr Gove had said that GCSES were a ""damaged brand"" that urgently needed replacing.
There were also plans to introduce a single exam board for each subject to avoid what had been described as a race to the bottom, with boards offering increasingly easy exams to schools.
What kind of exams will 16-year-olds take instead?
Instead of introducing a range of wholly new qualifications, Mr Gove said he was setting out the way in which he intends to tighten up and reform existing GCSEs.
With exams already at the end of the course and coursework restricted, Mr Gove has little else but the nature of questions to focus on. There would be fewer bite-sized and overly structured questions, he said, stressing that all assessments would ""normally"" be taken at the end of the course.
From 2015 in subjects such as English and history, the examinations will test essay writing, while in maths and science there would be a greater focus on quantitative problem solving.
This does however mean that new GCSE qualifications will be drawn up by competing exam boards for approval by Ofqual in a range of core subjects: English, maths, the sciences, history and geography.
The new GCSE will be a universal qualification, which means all children will sit it, said Mr Gove. This appears to end the situation where students are either put into higher or lower foundation tiers.
What else is being announced?
Proposals for a new national curriculum have been set out. This covers primary school pupils, aged five to 11, and secondary schools pupils up to the age of 16, and is the body of knowledge and learning that all state schools have to follow.  Mr Gove said all current national curriculum subjects were being retained.
Mr Gove had already made it clear he intended to bring in a slimmed down version and urge a return of the dominance of ""facts"". He said the new national curriculum would form a base for what schools would teach.
When was the national curriculum introduced?
In 1987, the then Education Secretary, Kenneth Baker, announced there was to be a statutory national curriculum in England and Wales. It was brought in in 1988. A national curriculum was introduced in Northern Ireland in 1992. The Scottish model is not directly comparable with the more rigid concept of a national curriculum in England. In recent years Scotland has had an over-arching framework that gives teachers guidance on what should be covered.
Why was the national curriculum brought in?
It was brought in because there were concerns there were inequalities in the curriculums being offered by schools. The national curriculum set out what children should be taught, with the aim of ensuring each pupil was given the same standard of education.
What subjects are currently included in the national curriculum in England?
The core national curriculum subjects are: English, mathematics, science and physical education. The remaining subjects are: art and design, citizenship, design and technology, geography, history, information and communication technology, modern foreign languages and music. Subjects are compulsory at various stages of pupils' school career.
How is the national curriculum currently organised?
It is currently organised on the basis of four key stages. Key Stage 1: Ages five to seven (Years 1-2), Key Stage 2: Ages seven to 11 (Years 3-6), Key Stage 3: Ages 11-14 (Years 7-9) and Key Stage 4: Ages 14-16 (Years 10-11). For each subject and for each key stage, programmes of study set out what pupils should be taught, and attainment targets set out the expected standards of pupils' performance. Schools choose how they organise their school curriculum to include the programmes of study.
Is it true that many schools do not have to follow the national curriculum anyway?
Yes. Academies - state-funded schools in England that are outside local authority control - have significant freedoms in what they teach. But realistically most academies do not depart wholly from the national curriculum but instead use it as a base for their own school curriculum.
So is the national curriculum still relevant?
It is still relevant, as it will be followed in the majority of England's schools. Most primary schools in England are not academies and there are still some 2,000 secondary schools that are not academies: these schools are bound by the curriculum. Furthermore, academies are likely to use the national curriculum as a guide, even though they have significant freedoms in how they teach the core content.
What is happening in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland?
Following devolution, a distinct curriculum was introduced in Wales, in September 2000, and was revised in 2008. Ministers have recently announced a review of the national curriculum and a review panel will report in July 2013. Scotland is currently implementing the Curriculum for Excellence, a major educational reform aimed at providing a wider, more flexible range of subjects and courses for children and young people aged three to 18. Its stated aim is to reduce spoon-feeding to pass exams and ensure pupils leave school able to think for themselves and deal with a fast-changing world. In Northern Ireland, a revised curriculum was introduced in 2007-08. It applies to all 12 years of compulsory education.","The English Baccalaureate Certificate (EBC) was a planned reform of the GCSE qualification in England, which was set to be phased in as replacements for GCSEs.

If the UK leaves the EU without a trade agreement it could default to World Trade Organisation rules, potentially facing tariffs on goods and services traded with the EU.
Mr Fox said the UK could ""of course survive with no deal"" but he wanted a ""full and comprehensive deal"" with the EU.
He also said ""the free trade agreement that we will have to come to with the European Union should be one of the easiest in human history"" because the UK already met EU standards.
Some MPs have called for the UK to remain in the EU's single market and customs union after Brexit. Some non-EU European countries, such as Norway, are members of the single market.
Mr Fox said that he did not ""have a problem"" with a transitional Brexit deal, which he described as an ""implementation phase"" but insisted: ""You can not leave the European Union and be in the single market and the customs union.""
Speaking after a speech in Geneva, where he is meeting the WTO's director general, Mr Fox implied that such a phase could last two years.
Earlier this month, Mr Fox told Bloomberg TV he would be ""very happy"" with a transitional phase lasting ""a few months"".
He told the BBC: ""We're going to leave [the EU] in March 2019.
""But if we can do it in a way that minimises or avoids any disruption to business, that provides them with the greatest amount of certainty and stability, then that's clearly a sensible thing to do.
""And if we have an implementation phase between us leaving the European Union and moving to whatever new arrangement and relationship we have with the EU,  I don't have any problem with that, for me there's no ideological barrier to that.""
Mr Fox said he had been waiting to leave the EU ""for a very long time, another two years, say, wouldn't be too much to ask"".
And he said the UK would want to be able to ""negotiate and conclude"" trade deals outside the EU after March 2019 - but that was something that would be subject to negotiation.
BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Fox's apparent acceptance of ""some kind of transition"" indicated ""a change in tone from Brexiteers"" since the general election.
Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: ""I think the penny has finally dropped even with Liam Fox, that what the Brexiteers had presented as a simple, straightforward process that could be completed within a couple of years, now they realise that there's probably going to be a couple of years on top of that, and even that may be an underestimate.""
Mr Fox's Labour shadow, Barry Gardiner, said any trade deal with the EU would have a political dimension.
Mr Gardiner said: ""Liam Fox seems to be saying it makes economic sense for the EU to give us a good deal and we already have the basis for that, so why don't they just say, 'Right, we'll keep it as it is.'?
""But of course that ignores the fact that the European Union too has its own political objectives, and they are about ever-closer union of the remaining 27 and ensuring that nobody of those 27 feels that they too might get a better deal outside of Europe than inside.""
Mr Fox also said earlier that the UK would take up an independent seat on the World Trade Organisation after Brexit and he believed that talks with the WTO indicated that ""we will simply replicate our current obligations under the European Union as we move into the United Kingdom as an independent member"".","The International Trade Secretary, Liam Fox, has indicated that there could be a two-year implementation phase after the UK officially leaves the EU in March 2019. He said there is no ideological barrier to such a phase, which would help businesses adjust to the new trade environment.

108,"Key figures in the cabinet openly disagreed about how to fight the summer war in Gaza and, while the government did manage to nominate a minister to talk to the Palestinians, it never agreed on what to say to them.
The events of the last few dramatic days in Jerusalem have given Israeli voters a much clearer insight into what the last two years of government must have been like - fractious, dysfunctional and ridden with mutual suspicion.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says senior ministers like Yair Lapid (Finance) and Tzipi Livni (Justice) were plotting to get rid of him, undermining his policies and ignoring his instructions.
They paint a picture of a prime minister presiding without much style over a chaotic collapse.
Mr Lapid is reported to have described how he ordered a coffee as the minister of finance and discovered before it was served that he had become leader of the opposition.
Ms Livni says she spent 45 minutes at a public event with Mr Netanyahu who did not speak to her throughout the proceedings but then phoned to fire her as soon as he got back in his car.
But this is not the story of an ideological meeting of minds that went wrong.
It is about a marriage of convenience that simply became inconvenient.
After the last elections in 2013, Benjamin Netanyahu found himself for the third time in a position to form a coalition government and faced a choice.
Alongside one obvious partner - Avigdor Lieberman's Yisrael Beitenu party which ran a combined list of candidates with Mr Netanyahu's Likud - he had various options to take him over the threshold for a parliamentary majority.
He could work with the small religious parties that represent ultra-Orthodox Jews or he could opt for a more secular coalition with a slightly centrist feel to it.
In the end he chose the second option.
That meant adding in Tzipi Livni, a former foreign minister who is relatively dovish on the Palestinian issue, and Yair Lapid, a household name as a TV presenter whose first run at parliament at the head of his own newly created party (Yesh Atid) had left him in a powerful position.
Neither is a natural ideological bedfellow of Mr Netanyahu and so the contradictions that brought down the coalition were there from the start.
None of this is a shock in the world of Israeli politics - the current coalition government is the 33rd to be created in the 66 years since the foundation of the state.
You do not need the powerful graphics computer of an election night TV programme to tell you that two years is around the average life of a coalition arrangement.
At least one poll has suggested that most Israelis are not convinced that it was really necessary to dissolve parliament and the influential newspaper Haaretz has described the coming elections as superfluous.
But the idea of a government proving transitory is not a shock here.
Mr Netanyahu is obviously gambling that by going to the country now he will put himself in a position to form a new coalition that would prove a little more durable.
He's already the second longest-serving prime minister in Israeli history.
In the, admittedly unlikely, event that the next parliament served out the whole of its five year term he would rival the founding premier, David Ben-Gurion, as the longest.
His likeliest course of action would almost certainly be to bring back the ultra-Orthodox parties alongside Mr Bennett and then hope to add a couple of smaller parties by offering them attractive ministries or adopting one or two of their pet policies.
You can see why there is speculation that the next round of coalition negotiations might be even trickier than usual.
But the Israeli political landscape is crowded and unpredictable.
Before the last election in 2013 it was regarded as almost certain that Mr Netanyahu would emerge in a position to build a new coalition.
In 2015 that still seems likelier than any other outcome but it also seems much less certain.
One unpredictable factor is the transience of some Israeli political parties - described here as ""mood"" or '""flavour of the month"" parties.
The sharpest recent example is the centrist Kadima movement which was the leading faction in a government as recently as 2009 but has only two members in the current Knesset and could easily disappear altogether from the next.
Mr Lapid's Yesh Atid party came literally from nowhere in the last election to take some Kadima votes and form a substantial parliamentary presence.
It may well shrink dramatically in 2015 as another wild card party led by the former minister Moshe Kahlon prepares to enter the contest.
He is a former minister from Mr Netanyahu's Likud Party who made himself popular by cutting Israel's ruinous mobile phone prices when he opened up the cellular market in his time as minister of communications.
He is reportedly building a new party and may provide the shock of the new this time as Mr Lapid did the last time.
His presence helps to make things unpredictable as does a new technical measure - the threshold for a party to enter the Knesset has gone up from 2% to 3.25% making the pollsters' predictions even trickier than usual.
There is a lot to watch.
The parties representing Israel's Arab minority may band into a single list this time and thus increase their influence - although they will remain part of the political process rather than part of the decision-making process.
Israeli politics is never boring. But however this works out the next prime minister will face the same problems that so troubled the last one - the economy, the Palestinian issue and the choppy diplomatic waters of the Middle East.
Some things never change.","The Israeli cabinet was divided over how to handle the summer war in Gaza, and the government never agreed on what to say to the Palestinians.

There was suspicion that the strategy was a deliberate move by Ferrari to get their leading driver into the lead but the team denied that was the case.
Hamilton finished seventh after a difficult race from 13th on the grid.
A largely dull race was enlivened by a late safety car after a collision involving McLaren's Jenson Button, on his one-off return to F1 in place of Fernando Alonso.
It closed up the field and led to a series of crashes and collisions among the backmarkers.
Raikkonen took his first pole position for nine years on Saturday after Vettel made mistakes on both his quick laps in the top-10 qualifying shootout.
The Finn converted his advantage into a lead at the first corner and the two Ferraris began to edge away from Valtteri Bottas' Mercedes and the two Red Bulls of Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo.
The race was always going to feature only one pit stop and there was speculation before the race over whether Ferrari would find a way to engineer the strategy to allow Vettel to win.
The way things panned out, it looked as if that was what happened.
Raikkonen made his pit stop on lap 34, at a time when there was no obvious requirement to do so, and he came out behind slower cars, which he had to lap.
Vettel used the opportunity to set a series of flying laps and by the time the German pitted five laps later, he had more than enough of an advantage to rejoin with a two-second lead.
He continued to pull quickly away from Raikkonen, building a 10-second lead within eight laps and cruised to his third win of the year, despite the late safety car period.
Ferrari said Raikkonen's stop was on the pre-planned lap and that they left Vettel out to avoid the risk of him being passed by Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo, who was also delaying his pit stop at the time.
Mercedes knew they would always struggle to make up too much ground with Hamilton after starting 13th because of a messy qualifying session, including a series of driving errors and problems with tyres.
They decided to run him long and hope to gain from his speed once he got some clear air, as cars pulled in to make their pit stops.
Hamilton ran until lap 46 before stopping, by which time he was sixth. He lost only one place, to Toro Rosso's Carlos Sainz, and ran seventh to the end, closing on the Spaniard but unable to pass him.
""The battle's not over, boys,"" Hamilton said over the radio in the closing laps. ""We'll take these points.""

Button's one-off return to Formula 1 as a replacement for Alonso, who was in America to race in the Indianapolis 500, ended in a crash with Sauber's Pascal Wehrlein.
The 2009 world champion started from the pits after McLaren made a decision to change his car set-up after qualifying because he was starting from the back after engine penalties.
The team pitted him on the first lap, the idea being to get the mandatory pit stop out of the way and hope to gain places.
But Sauber played the same strategy with Wehrlein and the German rejoined right in front of Button.
Sauber were found guilty of an unsafe release because Button had to lift in the pit lane to avoid contact, but the five-second time penalty Wehrlein received - which would have been applied post-race - did not help Button, who was still stuck behind the Sauber.
Finally, on lap 60, Button saw an opportunity to pass as they were lapped by Raikkonen and dived down the inside of Wehrlein's car at the Portier corner.
Button was halfway alongside, Wehrlein turned in and the cars collided, the Sauber rising up on to its side and coming to rest on its left-hand wheel rims with Wehrlein unhurt, but stuck in the cockpit against the barrier.
The safety car dramatically enlivened the last few laps.
Red Bull switched Verstappen on to fresh ultra-soft tyres to give him a chance to pass Bottas for fourth, after losing the position with an earlier strategy play.
Ricciardo had vaulted from fifth to third as a result of Red Bull splitting their strategies, with Verstappen failing in his attempt to pass Bottas by stopping first, and the Australian succeeding in doing so by running long and pitting later.
At the restart, Ricciardo hit the wall at Sainte Devote, the first corner, under pressure from Bottas but was able to continue without losing a position.

The three cars circulated together for the rest of the race, Bottas in a Red Bull sandwich, but all three were stuck and finished with Ricciardo taking the final podium place ahead of Bottas and Verstappen.
Earlier, Verstappen had not been happy about dropping behind his team-mate, using an expletive over the radio to describe the strategy plan as ""a disaster"".
Elsewhere, Sauber's Marcus Ericsson crashed out under the safety car, McLaren's Stoffel Vandoorne slid into the barriers when passed by Force India's Sergio Perez at the restart, and Perez collided with Toro Rosso's Daniil Kvyat at Rascasse, putting the Russian out of the race.
The Canadian Grand Prix on 11 June is held on one of Hamilton's favourite circuits, where he has always excelled. But Mercedes will be heading their with trepidation. It is the same sort of low-grip, low-abrasion circuit as Sochi and Monaco, where Hamilton has struggled, and the teams will also be using the ultra-soft tyre, which Mercedes are struggling to make work effectively. On the face of it, Ferrari will head there as strong favourites for another win.
Sebastian Vettel, P1: ""Unbelievable. It was a very tense race. I knew that was the chance to win and I was able to use that window and come out ahead. After that I was able to control the gap behind.""
On whether the pass on Raikkonen was pre-planned by the team: ""No, not really. The plan was to try and pull away which we did. Valtteri had good pace and then the window opened, as soon as Valtteri pitted Kimi responded. I still had some pace and I was able to keep going.""
Kimi Raikkonen, P2: ""Nothing to say really. Obviously it's still second place but it doesn't feel awfully good. But it is how it goes sometimes: we go to the next race and try to do better. It is one of those races when you hope to get more.""","In the Canadian Grand Prix, Sebastian Vettel led home team-mate Kimi Raikkonen after passing the Finn by running longer to their only pit stops. There was suspicion that the strategy was a deliberate move by Ferrari to get their leading driver into the lead but the team denied that was the case. Hamilton finished seventh after a difficult race from 13th on the grid. A largely dull race was enlivened by a late safety car after a collision involving McLaren's Jenson Button, on his one-off return to F1 in place of Fernando Alonso.</s>",mistral7b,XSUM,"The sentence ""In the Canadian Grand Prix"" is not inconsistent with the content<sep> but it is incomplete.<sep>Sebastian Vettel led home team-mate Kimi Raikkonen after passing the Finn by running longer to their only pit stops."

123,"The Tory leader said he had given a ""straight answer to a straight question"" and most people would think that was a ""sensible"" thing to do.
Labour said Mr Cameron was being ""arrogant and presumptuous"".
But most pundits said Mr Cameron's biggest mistake was to name his possible successors.
The PM suggested Theresa May, George Osborne or Boris Johnson were ready to fill his shoes when he stands down, potentially firing the starting gun on a Tory leadership race.
Asked what he was thinking of when he made the comments to the BBC's James Landale, Mr Cameron said:  ""What I did in my kitchen was give a very straight answer to a very straight question.
""And I think people will understand that a full second term, a full five years, is a very reasonable, sensible thing to say.""
He said he was ""taking absolutely nothing for granted"" when it came to May's general election and his ""entire focus is on the next 44 days and the general election that will decide which team runs the country for the next five years"".
Speaking at an Age UK event in Birmingham at which he faced heckles about the NHS from some of the audience, he said ruling out a third term would prevent ""endless political process five years hence"" if he returns to power in May.
Former Conservative Cabinet minister Michael Portillo described Mr Cameron's announcement as ""bizarre"".
He told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""When you play chess you have to consider the next two moves, and I don't think he did. There is no point setting off on this wild goose chase in the middle of an election campaign.""
May 2015: General election. If David Cameron wins an outright majority he will serve a full five-year term
May 2016: Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly elections
2017: EU referendum. The outcome will decide Britain's future relationship with Europe. Mr Cameron plans to campaign to keep the UK in the EU but if he is on the losing side he may be forced to step down as Tory leader earlier than planned
May 2019: European elections. If he is still Conservative leader, David Cameron may wish to wait until after the European elections to step down, which would still give his successor time to bed in before the next general election
May 2020: General election
Two of the possible contenders named by Mr Cameron to replace him have given their reaction to his comments.
London Mayor Boris Johnson, who is bidding to return to the Commons on 7 May, in the safe Tory seat of Uxbridge, said it was ""no big deal"".
""All he's saying is I think obvious and common sense, which is that he doesn't want to go on and on and on like Mrs Thatcher.
""But he's got five more years to complete the work of getting Britain's economic recovery on track, and there's still a lot to do, and he needs to make sure he's there to do it.""
Chancellor George Osborne said: ""I think it's really refreshing we have a prime minister who gives a direct answer to a direct question,""
Home Secretary Theresa May has yet to comment.
Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg joked that he would ""happily settle for two terms as prime minister"" as he left the coalition government's final cabinet meeting before the election.
The original comments from Mr Cameron came while being interviewed in his kitchen by the BBC's deputy political editor James Landale, as part of series of profiles of party leaders.
He said ""I've said I'll stand for a full second term. But I think after that it will be time for new leadership. Terms are like Shredded Wheat - two are wonderful but three might just be too many.""

By answering my question, Mr Cameron has potentially opened a Pandora's box.
He has invited Westminster and the country to contemplate a time when he is no longer prime minister and that is a dangerous gamble to make so close to an election.
He is telling the voters that they can back him one last time in May and then they can see the back of him in five years' time.
But his opponents will say he is making an arrogant presumption about the election result, an assumption that he will have the choice over whether to serve a third term.
In a few weeks' time, the voters may make that decision a little earlier for him.

But it passed the $1m-mark on Sunday, and has been forecast to raise more than $4m by the period's end.
Sense includes an orb that monitors the bedroom, a clip that attaches to the pillow, and a mobile phone app.
The equipment produces a unique score for the previous night's sleep and aims to wake the owner up at the best point in their sleep cycle.
It is due to be released in November and can be ordered in advance for $129.
Mr Proud said sleep was a natural area to focus on.
""We spend a third of our day doing it,"" he told the BBC.
""It's the most critical part of the day, as how we perform when we're awake depends on how well we slept.""
Sense is one of a growing number of sleep-focused products as ""smart"" technologies start to filter into homes, offering new ways to track our health.
Apps such as Sleep Cycle, Sleepbot and Sleepmaster are already used by iPhone, Android and Windows Phone users to track their slumber using sensors built into the handsets.
There are also specialist hardware devices such as Aura, from the French firm Withings, and a $8,000 ""snore-stopping"" bed.
Earlier this year, Apple announced its forthcoming Healthkit app, which can gather sleep-related data from third-party devices. The 9to5Mac news site also reported the company had hired Roy Raymann, a Dutch sleep research expert, fuelling speculation the company may be about to release its own sleep-monitoring smart watch.
Its rival Samsung, already offers the Gear 2 smartwatch, which runs sleep-tracking software. And most recently, China's Xiaomi began selling one of the cheapest sleep-monitoring wearables on the market - the $13 MiBand.
But one expert told the BBC such products had limited use beyond ""nagging"" the user to go to bed earlier.
""If you want to learn whether you sleep on certain nights and not on others, then it should be looked at as a form of harmless entertainment,"" Prof Jerry Siegel from University of California, Los Angeles' Center for Sleep Research said.
""But the most common sleep problem is insomnia, and there's nothing that you're going to get from one of these devices that is going to be useful in treating insomnia.
""The other problem that is important to identify is sleep apnoea [a condition where the walls of the throat relax and interrupt breathing].
""We know that this will shorten your lifespan and we have several treatments... but none of these devices will help you detect it.""
However, the US's National Sleep Foundation was more optimistic about the potential benefits of such innovations in May, when it announced a partnership with the US's Consumer Electronics Association to create new standards for sleep-related tech.
""We know that getting enough sleep and getting quality sleep have amazing health benefits, including improved mood, concentration, memory and productivity, and the ability to maintain a healthy weight,"" said David Cloud, chief executive of the foundation.
""Given the technology to properly monitor their own sleep quality, consumers can better understand the link between their sleep and their health, and set goals for improvement.""
Mr Proud, was born in South London but developed Sense in California.
He took a gap-year break between school and university. ""If I went to university, I quickly realised I couldn't code 18 hours a day,"" he told the BBC.
He ended up moving to California to take a ""fellowship"" from Peter Thiel, the co-creator of PayPal and one of the first people to put money into Facebook.
The move secured him a $100,000 grant to forgo higher education and instead build his own tech start-up.
The young entrepreneur raised more money and started Hello, the company that makes Sense.
Hello currently employs about 20 people, including engineers and product designers, who are responsible for its distinctive look.
""We wanted to make something that didn't look like technology, but that looked like it should be there regardless,"" said Mr Proud.
He added that he planned to use the additional cash raised from Kickstarter to fulfil more orders and get the kit into the hands of more people.
Based on the amount of money the campaign has raised so far, the analytics site Kicktraq projects that Sense should raise between £4m and $7m by the end of its funding period.
But Mr Proud said he created the crowdfunding campaign not for cash but rather for feedback.
""The valuable thing about Kickstarter is the community,"" he said.

127,"In his regular BBC Sport column, Robbie Savage looks at which managers are most at risk of being the first to lose their jobs in the Premier League this season, and why we will not have to wait long to see the first top-flight managerial casualty.
Forget unhappy fans, player power or impatient owners - there is one big reason why managers of teams at the bottom of the table are at risk, and his name is Tony Pulis.
It is not his fault, but all the chairmen and owners out there will see what Pulis did at Crystal Palace last season, when he came in and kept the Eagles up, and think 'he saved them, and he can save us'.
Despite what some Arsenal and Liverpool fans might say - and I have heard a few idiotic comments from them on my 606 show on BBC Radio 5 live - there is nobody available right now who could improve on Arsene Wenger or Brendan Rodgers at the top end of the Premier League. They are under pressure, but they are staying put.
But, with Pulis waiting in the wings, it is a different story for the clubs fighting relegation.
The men in most danger of losing their jobs - wrongly, in my view - are Leicester City's Nigel Pearson, West Brom's Alan Irvine and QPR's Harry Redknapp.
Redknapp finds himself in the reverse of the position he was in two years ago when, like Pulis is now, he was out of work but seen as the potential saviour for several struggling teams.
QPR took the plunge, sacked Mark Hughes, and appointed Harry.
Now we are waiting to see who will crack first and go for Pulis.
It is unusual that it has not happened already - if everyone survives the weekend then it will be 18 years since we have got as far into a season without any top-flight managers changing jobs, and there will have been only two seasons in the Premier League era where there has been a longer wait.
That is partly down to the table being so close - nobody is out of touch with the top four or cut adrift at the bottom.
But, with Christmas fast approaching, the first sacking will definitely happen soon. The January transfer window always seems to help chairmen make their mind up about whether they have the right man for the job, and to spend their money.
When your owner has a big helicopter that lands on the pitch to pick him up after every home game, like Leicester's Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha does, then you know he is seriously rich and wants to stay in the Premier League.
Unfortunately for Foxes boss Nigel Pearson, my old club are bottom of the table with two points from their last nine games and every mistake his team makes at the moment seems to lead to an opposition goal.
I hope they stick with Pearson, because he is a good manager who got them up in the first place.
Knowing how hard winning promotion to the Premier League is, I think he should be given a full season to try to keep him there. Ideally, he would be in the same situation as Burnley's Sean Dyche, who is under no pressure whatsoever.
But being realistic, things do not look good for Pearson and he is the manager who is most at risk.
West Brom manager Alan Irvine is not far behind him, though.
You might think Irvine would get a bit more time because, apart from his predecessor Pepe Mel, each of the Baggies' last five managers got at least 15 months, and Irvine has only been in charge since June.
But this time last year, they got rid of Steve Clarke after four straight defeats, which is exactly the run Irvine is on now.
I have spoken to Clarke since his exit and he said that, when it happened, he had no inkling he was about to be sacked.
Sam Allardyce has shown with West Ham that, if you are brave and stick with your manager, you sometimes get your rewards
He made the point that, at a club like West Brom, you will go on runs like that every season and it is down to the chairman Jeremy Peace to stick with the manager.
Irvine, who was a surprise appointment in the first place, could be about to find out how much patience Peace has got. His next three games are all against fellow strugglers - Hull, Aston Villa and QPR - and West Brom's form has to improve soon.
The next few games will be massive for Harry Redknapp at QPR too, starting against Burnley on Saturday.
As well as Pulis, Redknapp has got Glenn Hoddle in the background at Loftus Road as a potential replacement, and an owner in Tony Fernandes who has shown he is not afraid to change things when his side have struggled in the past.
Does it work? It did for Palace with Pulis. But sacking their manager did not help any of the three relegated teams last season, when Fulham tried it twice.
After watching Leicester play Liverpool this week, and from what I've seen of West Brom and QPR recently, all of those teams looked like they were still playing for their manager.
That will help them, but it won't necessarily save them. At Leicester in 2001, I was one of a few senior players who went to see the chairman when Peter Taylor was under pressure, because we liked him.
We asked for him to be given more time and bought him a few more games but, in the end, results dictated he had to go - they always do.
So far this season, there has been speculation about 11 of the 20 Premier League managers losing their jobs.
There were newspaper reports last month that Neil Warnock was on the brink of getting sacked by Crystal Palace after only a few games in charge, but I don't see it happening myself.
At least Warnock does not have to worry about stories that Pulis is going to get his job, because he only left Selhurst Park in August and there is no way he is going back there.
Paul Lambert is unpopular with the Aston Villa fans but, if you look at his win-ratio since he took over, he is not doing any worse this season than before.
Villa owner Randy Lerner stuck by him before, plus he gave him a new four-year contract in September. He is surely not going to get rid of him now.
Speaking of win-ratios, Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino's is lower than that of both of his predecessors; Tim Sherwood and Andre Villas-Boas.
Pochettino has only been in charge since the summer but he is already under pressure because of the record that Spurs chairman Daniel Levy has in getting rid of his managers who fall short of expectations.
His job certainly shouldn't be in danger, though, because Spurs need stability now.
I don't think they will make the top four, but they need to stick with a manager for a longer period and give him a chance.
I remember thinking not so long ago that Manchester City were on the brink of a crisis, but their transformation in form has been incredible.
Even so, I think City boss Manuel Pellegrini has to deliver in the Champions League.
Like Liverpool boss Rodgers, he needs a result in his side's final group game next week. But while I think Rodgers is safe whatever happens, it is a much bigger game for Pellegrini.
We are talking about the end of the season, not anytime soon, but his long-term future could depend on City reaching the knockout stages - you only have to look at what happened to his predecessor Roberto Mancini when he failed in Europe.
It is only a couple of weeks since Brendan Rodgers claimed he was favourite to get sacked, but he is not alone in being a manager who has responded to pressure with hugely improved results.
We all saw the banner telling Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger it was time to go, but he is now on a run of three wins with three clean sheets.
A season with Wenger is like watching a James Bond film, in that you know exactly what you are going to get - for car chases, gadgets and a villain who always loses in the end, you get a cup run, the knockout stages of the Champions League and, eventually, the top four in the Premier League again.
Even if the board does want to try something new, then it is not going to happen mid-season, and Wenger is never going to be sacked.
Newcastle manager Alan Pardew's future looked far less secure a couple of months ago, when he came under the most pressure I have ever seen a manager have to deal with, and he showed great character to cope with it.
In September, I wrote in one of my BBC Sport columns that Pardew sounded like a broken man and that it was hard to see him surviving in his job for much longer, but I am delighted that he has proved me wrong.
Magpies owner Mike Ashley stuck by Pardew in the bad times and now his job has to be one of the safest there is.
It has been a similar story for Sam Allardyce at West Ham, who was widely expected to be the first manager to be sacked this season.
Like Pardew, he had to deal with fans saying he had to go, but Allardyce's critics were on his back for his team's style of play as well as results.
Look at how things have changed now on both counts. It has taken him a while to get there but it just goes to show that, if you are brave and stick with your manager, you sometimes get your rewards.

The case was brought on behalf of Spirit's late guitarist, Randy Wolfe.
His estate claims the opening riff of the 1968 song Taurus is fundamentally the same as the iconic opening bars of Stairway to Heaven. Defence lawyers argue the chord progression in question is very common and has been in use for more than 300 years.
The prosecution has argued Led Zeppelin became familiar with Spirit's song after the two bands played on the same bill in Plant's hometown at the Birmingham club Mother's in 1970.
Spirit's bassist Mark Andes testified last week he met Plant at the show and played snooker with him afterward.
Plant insisted he had no memory of that night, saying that in all the ""hubbub and chaos"" it would be hard to remember a one-off meeting 40 years ago.
""I can't actually recall Spirit or anyone playing there with the passing of time,"" he said.
Plant partially attributed his lack of memory to a bad car crash on his way home from the club. Both he and his wife suffered head injuries in the accident, he told the court, after the windshield of his Jaguar was left ""buried"" in his face.
The singer-songwriter also spoke at length about the creation of Stairway to Heaven.
He reiterated the assertions made by his bandmates Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones that the song began at the country estate Headley Grange and not the Welsh cottage Bron-Yr-Aur, contradicting decades of Led Zeppelin mythology.
""One evening, Jimmy Page and I sat by the fire going over bits and pieces,"" Plant testified, explaining the band had worked on several other songs that night, including Misty Mountain Hop and Battle of Evermore.
He recalled when guitarist Jimmy Page played the introduction to the song, things had started ""rolling pretty fast"".
""It was quite a thing,"" Plant said, to ""see it develop into something I couldn't imagine"".
He retired to another room to work on the lyrics, inspired by the ""pastoral areas of Britain I love"", and initially came up with a ""little couplet"" to open the song.
When asked what the couplet was, Plant replied ""Oh, gosh"" before half-singing, half-speaking the lyrics: ""There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold and she's buying a stairway to heaven.""
Plant's lawyer, Peter Anderson, also asked the vocalist whether he could read or write music. ""I haven't learned yet,"" he replied laughing - the insinuation being that, even if he had wanted to copy Taurus, he could not have transcribed the guitar riff and given it to Jimmy Page.
Page later took the stand himself, and spoke further about the creation of Stairway, which he described as ""an ambitious piece"".
Jurors listened to demo recordings of the song, and heard Page describe how he worked to create a song that built from the gentle acoustic opening to a thrilling electric guitar solo.
The tapes showed how the song developed, including a guitar part that Page later discarded. The lyrics were not fully formed, with Plant's hook, ""it makes me wonder"" notably absent.
The song was also in a different key - and Plant screwed up his face when the court heard a strained, poorly-pitched note in the final tape.
After playing the nascent recordings, Anderson aired the full, finished, eight-minute version of Stairway to Heaven for the jury.
Afterwards he asked Page one simple question: Is this Stairway to Heaven, as written by Page and Plant? ""Yes, it is,"" Page answered. With that, the defence rested their case.
The jury is expected to start their deliberations on Wednesday.
Lawyers for Page and Plant had previously asked Judge R Gary Klausner to rule on the case without sending it to the jury, but he refused the request.","The case involves a claim by the estate of Randy Wolfe, the late guitarist of Spirit, that Led Zeppelin stole the opening riff of their song Taurus for their iconic hit Stairway to Heaven.

An initial assessment led engineers to predict that the line could be back to normal operation by 1 February.
They have now said that a new timetable for repairs will not be issued until next week.
Phil Verster, of Scotrail Alliance, said: ""By next week we will announce to the public what our full recovery date will be for the West Coast Main Line.
""A significant amount of work is being done now to stabilise the pier.
""We are not exactly sure what our repair programme will be for the remaining period during January but we will announce that by the back end of next week.""
Since the damage was caused during Storm Frank, main line trains have been operating from London to Carlisle. Passengers have to change there, using a replacement bus service or a shuttle rail service via Dumfries to reach Glasgow.
Mr Verster added: ""I set the deadline of the 1st of February at a time when we understood the damage to be less than what we have seen now.
""So we are going to do everything by next week to finalise what the programme should be and can be for the further extended work that we now have to do to recover the pier.""
Heavy rain in the last few days of 2015 left the River Clyde swollen at the point where the railway line crosses it at Lamington.
The waters have now receded, leaving the structure unsafe for trains to pass over the viaduct.
""This is a massive challenge for us,"" admitted Mr Verster.
""The damage we have found in the last couple of days has been much more severe than we thought. Turbulence and vortices actually undermined the structure of the pier significantly.
""We are now in a programme to stabilise that pier by Sunday and next week we will finalise our programme for the repair.""
The site of the work at Lamington has been visited by Scottish transport minister Derek Mackay and UK railways minister Claire Perry.
Mr Mackay said: ""We appreciate the patience of the travelling public whose journeys have been disrupted as a consequence of both significant weather events and other structural problems such as we've seen here.
""There's been record spending and there'll be a continuation of that record spending on both infrastructure and rolling stock  - and indeed new technology. But of course we can look at further devices and learn lessons from incidents such as this.""
The UK government has been emphasising how much is being allocated to railway investment.
Ms Perry said: ""We are investing record amounts of Â£38bn over the next five years and part of that is of course to make sure - whether it's sea walls at Dawlish or bridge structures across flood-prone parts of the country - they are safe.""
She admitted she could not say exactly how much is being spent on climate resilience.

The company denied coercing her into saying sorry to appease angered Chinese audiences, a key market for JYP.
The row erupted on the eve of Taiwan's election, which was won by pro-independence Tsai Ing-wen.
Taiwan has been ruled separately since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, but it is seen by China, as a breakaway province which it has  threatened to take back by force if necessary.
JYP told South Korea's Yonhap news agency that its website had been inaccessible since Saturday, the day after Chou's apology was put online.
It said it suspected a DDoS (distributed denial of service) attack, where multiple users visit a website repeatedly to overwhelm its servers, but that it did not know where it was coming from.
It said getting the site back on line ""may take a while"".
Chou, a member of the Kpop group Twice, carried the flag of the Republic of China - Taiwan's official name - in a section on a South Korean TV show in November introducing the band members.
The scene didn't appear on air but was widely shared online in China, and brought up in Taiwan during the election campaign by a noted anti-independence celebrity.
Chou was widely criticised and the band had an New Year's Eve appearance on Chinese TV cancelled.

The 35-year-old grew up in that quiet Scottish Borders town, which became eternally etched in the collective conscience when Pan Am flight 103 was blown up over its streets and fields on 21 December 1988.
All 259 people on board and 11 residents of the town died. Lockerbie life was changed forever.
Murdoch was 10 and watched it all happen from his father's car.
""I was about 300 yards away and I saw it come down,"" he said. ""I was in a car driving back home. I was on an adjacent street. It was just like a bomb going off.
""They used the rink as a morgue and a lot of troops were using our farm to land on. There were lots of bodies scattered all over Lockerbie so they were using the farm to put the Chinooks down.""
Murdoch rarely brings up that part of his background, preferring not to let it colour his curling achievements. But with an Olympic silver medal now in his pocket, he is already planning his return home.
""There was the anniversary with Lockerbie recently and there were tough times there,"" he said.
""No-one can forget what happened and I want to give something back for all the support they've given me.
""It's a real nice town with a lot of good people in it and I'd love to walk through there with an Olympic medal.""
GB's women's curlers Claire Hamilton and Anna Sloan were also born in the town, although after the tragedy.
Hamilton, a qualified pharmacist, said after they beat Switzerland to win the bronze medal: ""Lockerbie is known for the disaster but maybe with these medals we can change that. Hopefully we will be associated with sporting success rather than something so unpleasant.'""
In Turin eight years ago, Murdoch's men lost in the bronze-medal match. At Vancouver 2010, they turned up as world champions but finished fifth. Four years later - and after spending almost his entire adult life in the quest for Olympic glory - Murdoch now has a prized silver medal to show for his efforts.
""Incredible, I cannot describe the feeling,"" said Murdoch, after a tense, last-stone semi-final win against Sweden sealed Great Britain's place in the final against Canada. ""That's a reward for 12 years of dedicating yourself to a sport, to beating your body up, going through injuries, hammering the fitness and throwing down 100 stones a day, and a lot of sacrifices and it has paid off.""
No-one can forget what happened and I want to give something back for all the support they've given me
Murdoch's curling prowess was sculpted on that Scottish ice from the age of seven, another product - like women's skip Eve Muirhead - of solid curling stock.
His sister Nancy is an Olympic coach and older brother Neil is a former European champion, while David was a member of the junior World Championship-winning teams in 1995 and 1996.
Murdoch rose to the role as skip in 1999, and four years later took his Scotland team to the European title, with Neil as second. He clinched silver at his first World Championships in 2005 and avenged the disappointment of Turin by guiding Scotland to the world title just a few months later.
Going to Vancouver, Murdoch's rink were among the favourites, but were unable to live up to their billing.
""I don't think we suffered from the pressure,"" he said. ""I think it was form. We never really had good form and if you don't have that it's a tough thing to get going.""
In a bid to make the small gains that create a champion, Murdoch moved to Stirling to be closer to the national training centre, where endless hours on the ice, fitness work, lifting weights, nutritionists and psychologists were the daily routine.
But he was soon sidelined by a serious shoulder problem, while Sochi team-mate Tom Brewster, 39, took his rink to the silver medal at both the 2011 and 2012 world championships.
When Murdoch was fit again he was drafted in to Brewster's team to add some experience, and took them to third at both the European and World Championships.
""The boys have worked so hard to get to the Olympic final and the delight at the winning the semi-final was clear on Dave Murdoch's face.""
In October, Murdoch was given the nod as GB skip for Sochi, while Brewster had to settle for a role as alternate.
""I'm the unlucky one,"" said Brewster, who was Murdoch's skip at the junior worlds in 1995. ""Any of the five of us could be sitting where I am.""
Coming into the Games, Murdoch exuded a relaxed air, happy to let Muirhead's world champions soak up more of the hype.
""For me this time round, the drive to win is huge but the pressure is very low,"" he said. ""I don't feel like there's any pressure on us at all. We can fly under the radar a little bit.""
Murdoch has certainly performed with a clear head, guiding his men to the semi-final with a double take-out - ""one of his best shots ever"" - to beat Norway and following up with a match-winning final stone against Sweden.
Though he will be disappointed not to have produced his best form in the final, in which Britain were beaten 9-3 by Canada, his silver medal will certainly be well-received back home in Lockerbie.","The article is about David Murdoch, a Scottish curler who won a silver medal at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.

145,"Manager Antonio Conte and his Chelsea players were able to take the acclaim on a lap of honour after the final whistle - but they were made to work for the win by a fired-up and physical Watford.
John Terry, who will leave at the end of the season after more than two decades at the club, celebrated his first league start since September by scoring Chelsea's 100th goal in all competitions this term. It came after 22 minutes before he then gifted Watford's Etienne Capoue an instant equaliser with a poor header.
Cesar Azpilicueta restored Chelsea's lead with a crisp finish before half-time and the contest looked over when Michy Batshuayi, who scored the title-winning goal at West Bromwich Albion on Friday, added a third just after the break.
Watford, however, showed commendable fight. Daryl Janmaat's fine solo effort put the visitors within reach before substitute Stefano Okaka, who was given his Italy debut by Chelsea boss Conte, took advantage of defensive uncertainty to slam in an equaliser.
Chelsea, as so often this season, found a way to win as substitute Cesc Fabregas struck from the edge of the area with three minutes left - while Watford's misery was compounded when Sebastian Prodl was sent off for a second yellow card in stoppage time.
Conte can do no wrong and he was being cheered at Stamford Bridge within seconds of appearing in his technical area after winning the Premier League at the first time of asking.
This was a night for Chelsea to bask in the glory of their success and hard work this season, and after a slow start, the crowd warmed to the occasion.
For Conte, it was also the opportunity to give some of his shadow squad game time, with the likes of Thibaut Courtois and Nemanja Matic given the night off and Diego Costa, Fabregas, Pedro, Gary Cahill and Marcos Alonso on the bench.
It was not simply a matter of giving Terry a game and showcasing younger talent such as Nathan Ake and Nathaniel Chalobah - this was a selection with a glance towards the forthcoming FA Cup final against Arsenal at Wembley.
Chelsea's lack of familiarity showed in an uncharacteristically shoddy defensive performance while the lack of spark in some of the display was perhaps the result of mental and physical energy expended in getting the title win over the line.
The perfectionist Conte will be unhappy with parts of this performance, but he will also see the bigger picture.

Terry is on the victory lap of his Chelsea career, with only Sunday's final home game against Sunderland remaining before the curtain comes down.
Chelsea's title win enabled Conte to give Terry his first league start since the 2-2 draw at Swansea City on 11 September last year, and first start in any competition since the FA Cup fifth-round win at Wolverhampton Wanderers on 18 February.
It was a night of mixed fortunes for the 36-year-old, whose goal meant he had scored in his 17th successive Premier League season.
Terry scrambled home that landmark goal but then made that uncharacteristic error to allow Capoue in for the equaliser.
Chelsea's defence was not at its best but Terry was leading from the front as usual, even diving into an injury-time melee when players from both sides squared up to each other.
Terry is not going quietly from Chelsea - but that will come as no surprise.
It was fitting that Azpilicueta got himself on the scoresheet with a drilled low finish to put Chelsea 2-1 up - a rightful reward for a player whose outstanding consistency makes him a key component of this title-winning team.
Azpilicueta has been almost faultless as a vital part of the three-man defence that transformed Chelsea's season, and while he may be underrated and unsung outside Stamford Bridge, there is no underestimating the importance Conte, his team-mates and fans put on the 27-year-old Spain defender.
Chelsea boss Antonio Conte told BBC Sport: ""It's a big night because we won the title. I made a decision to make nine changes and give the chance to start a lot of young players. I must be pleased because the answer was very good.

147,"Many know the dispiriting feeling when the summer holiday flight they had their eye on suddenly goes up Â£50, or the Uber they call on a Friday night is four times the price they paid the day before.
This is known as ""surge"" or ""dynamic"" pricing - when the cost of an item is dictated by demand. And while it's common in the hospitality and travel sectors, the high street has generally stuck to the fixed-price model.
But now, digital displays coupled with the analysis of vast amounts of customer data is enabling retailers to change the cost of hundreds of thousands of items instantaneously and play with prices in real time to attract specific types of customer at precise times during the day.
In the US for example, Coca-Cola has been using Google's cloud platform to send videos and discount coupons to customers' smartphones in Albertsons grocery stores.
Digital signs encourage shoppers to find the soft drinks aisle, where they are then targeted with personalised special offers and content based on their online browsing habits and spending profiles.
While some see this as an invasion of privacy, the industry sees it as a good example of ""location-based"" marketing coupled with dynamic pricing.
So in future, the prices you are offered in-store might be for you and you only.
""We can understand who the consumer is and get the right content and messaging to him or her at the right time,"" Greg Chambers, global group director of digital innovation for Coca-Cola said at a Google conference earlier this year.
""We're using the power of the cloud to bring a real-time, media-rich experience to shoppers in the store.""
And this dynamic pricing trend could be coming to the UK.
Last year, Marks and Spencer conducted an electronic pricing trial where sandwiches were sold at a discount in the morning to encourage shoppers to buy their lunch early.
While the company isn't currently planning to do this more widely, it comes as several of the large supermarkets are trialling the idea.
Sainsbury's says it ran an electronic pricing trial two years ago - but wouldn't say what conclusions it reached - while Morrisons and Tesco are each currently trying out the system in one of their stores.
They all say that the aim behind the scheme isn't to bring in dynamic pricing, but don't deny that it will make switching between prices easier.
Electronic pricing means supermarkets ""will be able to flex their prices a lot more"", says Neil Mason, European analyst at market research firm Mintel.
""Retail is really tough nowadays - you've got to be quick to respond and e-pricing is the way to do that,"" he says. ""It's about being more efficient and responsive to what is happening in the marketplace.
""They might want to increase prices on certain products because of inflationary pressure, but also might want to decrease prices because of promotions - so it could be good for consumers.
""At the end of the day supermarkets have to be keen on price competition, especially now the big discounters have entered the sector.""
More Technology of Business
In the UK, an intense price war between the discounters, Lidl and Aldi, and the ""big four"" - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Asda - as well as growing competition from online retailers such as Ocado and Amazon, has taken its toll on profit margins.
On top of that, food prices are rising as inflation pushes up the cost of imports, something that supermarkets are loath to pass on to their customers.
Meanwhile, those customers are feeling the pinch as wages fail to keep up with the cost of living.
In this context, perhaps it was only a matter of time before electronic pricing made the move to UK retail, an area that is constantly looking at ways to innovate.
Displaydata, one of the world's leading suppliers of electronic shelf labels, confirms that electronic pricing's newfound popularity in the UK has transformed their Berkshire-based business.
Chief executive Andrew Dark says: ""It's fascinating for us because up until the last 12 months we have been a UK company that was effectively a 100% exporter.
""This phenomenon has been building in Europe and the US and has now arrived on our shores, which is great. I think there are a number of reasons, not least that UK retailers are very conscious of their consumers.""
Mr Dark estimates that if the technology were implemented in every store, 10 million prices could be changed within 24 seconds, not only speeding up the process but helping to cut food waste and making pricing more accurate.
""I think most major retail outlets will move to this over the next five years - it's a global trend, not just a UK trend.""
Electronic displays like Displaydata's can be operated remotely using wireless technology from a single server and a computer at the retailer's HQ.
Alongside changing thousands of prices simultaneously, shops can use the labels to convey information about stock availability, social media reviews and, as in the case of Coca-Cola in the US, connect with smartphones to send customers targeted promotions.
Toby Pickard, senior innovations and trends analyst at food and grocery research charity IGD, agrees digitalising price labels has many benefits for big supermarkets, once they get past the initial set-up costs.
""Retailers will be able to gain more data about the products they sell. For example, they can closely gauge how prices fluctuating throughout the day may alter shoppers' purchasing habits, or if on-shelf digital product reviews increase sales in-store.""
Digital pricing could also help persuade customers to buy new products.
""By making fixtures stand out more, they can encourage customers to try new products and make impulse purchases,"" says Mr Pickard.
""Systems like this could encourage further customer interaction through smartphones, change messaging by time of day, and perhaps offer dynamic pricing.""
The big unknown is how we consumers will take to the idea of uncertain prices in an already uncertain world.","The document discusses the concept of dynamic pricing, where the cost of an item is determined by demand.

But Amazon Web Services (AWS), which powers many net firms, only uses 15% clean energy, according to the report.
The retail giant hit back, branding the report ""inaccurate"".
The green activist group warned that more needed to be done to make the internet greener, particularly in countries experiencing huge net growth such as China.
The electricity demand of internet and cloud services has grown exponentially, according to the report, Clicking Clean: How Companies are Creating the Green Internet.
And it is expected to increase by 60% or more by 2020 as reliance on the internet increases.
""Apple, Facebook and Google are powering our online lives with clean energy and building a greener offline world for everyone in the process,"" said Gary Cook, Greenpeace's senior IT analyst.
It  represents a turnaround for Apple which two years ago was criticised in a 2012 Greenpeace report, How Green is Your Cloud.
The firm went from a 35% use of renewable energy in 2010 to 75% by the end of 2012.
Amazon though has remained on Greenpeace's blacklist.
Amazon Web Services, which hosts a large part of the internet including for companies such as Netflix, Spotify, Tumblr, AirBnB and Pinterest, currently only sources 15% of its electricity demand with clean energy, according to the report.
Coal powers 28% of the company's cloud, nuclear 27% and gas 25%.
""By continuing to buy dirty energy, Amazon Web Services not only can't seem to keep up with Apple, but is dragging much of the internet down with it,"" Mr Cook said.
Greenpeace also criticised Amazon and Twitter for their refusal to reveal any details about their energy footprint to their customers or the public.
In response, Amazon told the BBC: ""Greenpeace's report misses the mark by using false assumptions on AWS operations and inaccurate data on AWS energy consumption.""
It was not able to elaborate on what the inaccuracies were but said that two of its data centres used 100% carbon-free power.
""Running IT infrastructure on the AWS Cloud is inherently more energy efficient than traditional computing that depends on small, inefficient, and over-provisioned data centres,"" it said.
Of the 19 leading internet companies evaluated by Greenpeace, only five have committed to a goal of powering their operations with 100% renewable energy.
Apple was the first firm to achieve its 100% renewable energy goal. It operates the largest privately owned solar installation in the US at its North Carolina data centre.
Meanwhile Facebook is powering its utility in Iowa with wind energy, which in turn prompted energy firm MidAmerican to invest $1.9bn (Â£1.1bn) in wind power energy.

The findings, published in Archives of Internal Medicine, come from a study of more than 50,000 US female nurses.
The experts are now recommending more work to better understand the link.
And they say it is certainly too soon to start recommending that women should drink more coffee to boost mood.
The Harvard Medical School team tracked the health of the women over a decade from 1996 to 2006 and relied on questionnaires to record their coffee consumption.
Just over 2,600 of the women developed depression over this time period.
More of these women tended to be non- or low-coffee drinkers rather than frequent coffee consumers.
Compared with women who drank one cup of caffeinated coffee or less per week, those who consumed two to three cups per day had a 15% decreased risk of developing depression.
Those who drank four or more cups a day cut their risk by 20%.
Regular coffee drinkers were more likely to smoke and drink alcohol and were less likely to be involved in church, volunteer or community groups. They were also less likely to be overweight and have high blood pressure or diabetes.
Even after controlling for all of these variables, the trend of increasing coffee consumption and lower depression remained.
The researchers say their findings add weight to the work of others which found lower suicide rates among coffee drinkers.
They suspect caffeine is the key player - it is known to enhance feelings of wellbeing and energy.

And it has a physical effect on brain function and transmission by altering chemical pathways, like those involving adenosine. But more research is needed to show if this might mean it is useful for warding off depression.
Alternatively, it might be that people with low moods chose not to drink coffee because it contained caffeine, point out the researchers. One of the common symptoms of depression is disturbed sleep, and caffeine can exacerbate this because it is a stimulant.
Too much caffeine can also increase feelings of anxiety.
Prof Bertil Fredholm, an expert in pharmacology and physiology at Sweden's Karolinska Institute, said the findings were reassuring for coffee-lovers.
""This fits nicely with a lot of the previous work and what we know about caffeine and the brain. It blocks adenosine, which produces a similar effect to increasing dopamine production. And it's becoming increasingly clear that the dopamine-rich areas of the brain are much more important in depression than previously thought.

154,"It said the phrase is unbiblical, un-Protestant, and a form of superstition connected to Catholicism.
RIP is an abbreviation of 'rest in peace' or in Latin, 'requiescat in pace'.
In a publication marking the 500th anniversary of the Reformation, the order called on Protestants to stop using the phrase.
Wallace Thompson, secretary of Evangelical Protestants Northern Ireland, wrote a Facebook post on which the article was based.
He told the BBC's Talkback programme: ""Observing social media, we have noticed that the letters RIP are used a lot by Protestants, and by some evangelical Protestants.""
Mr Thompson explained that for him, 'RIP' is a prayer and he did not encourage prayers for the dead.
""From a Protestant point of view, we believe, when death comes, a person either goes to be with Christ for all eternity, or into hell.
""That's what we believe the gospel to be and in this 500th anniversary year of the Reformation, I think Luther, when the scales fell off his eyes, realised that it was all by faith alone, in Christ alone, the decision is made during life, on this earth, so that when death comes it has been made and no decision has been made after death,"" he said.
Speaking on the same programme, former Presbyterian moderator Dr Ken Newell said he did not use the phrase very often.
""I think when people use [RIP] in social media, there's a remembrance and a good wish in it, almost a blessing,"" he said.
He disagreed that people are praying for the dead when they used the phrase.
""If folk in the Orange Order want to take this line that's perfectly up to them, they are making a good point.
""I think ordinary people have not worked out the issues. This comes out of the human heart,"" he added.
In response to a request for a spokesperson of the issue, the Orange Order referred the BBC to comments made by the county grand master of County Fermanagh Grand Orange Lodge, Stuart Brooker, in the Impartial Reporter newspaper.
In it he said: ""I think the message in the article is very clear and well put together, and I couldn't add anything further to it.
""This article clearly explains why we as Protestants, and members of the Orange Institution, shouldn't use the term 'RIP'.
""It also reminds us that if we need guidance in any matter, we should refer to what the bible teaches.""

155,"BBC Radio 4's Face the Facts spoke to dozens of workers who were paid little or nothing, were not allowed out and were sometimes abused or beaten.
The situations come from ""tied"" visas - meaning the right to be in the UK can be withdrawn by the employer - and ""transit"" visas on fishing boats.
Ministers said a review was under way.
Transit visas are being used to bring in recruits to the fishing industry who have no right to set foot on dry land - and therefore no access to UK employment rights.
Face the Facts found this led to some fishing workers spending weeks at a time at sea, sometimes unpaid, sleeping in cramped conditions, often physically and verbally abused.
With tied visas, employees must stay with the employer they arrived to work for - so if they are mistreated and run away, they are likely to be deported.
Modern slavery minister Karen Bradley said: ""We do know that there are problems; that's why I've just commissioned an independent review of the visa arrangements for overseas domestic workers.""
The government's Modern Slavery Bill, which has cross-party support, will not affect tied or transit visas.

It will increase the maximum sentence to life imprisonment, introduce an anti-slavery commissioner and give courts new powers to order compensation.

The Zika virus can severely damage a newborn's brain.
The antibody therapy is made using blood cells from people who have recently had and fought off Zika.
In mice, the treatment significantly reduced the amount of Zika virus that circulated in the mother's blood and crossed the placenta into the baby, Nature journal reports.
At birth, there was less damage to the placenta and these baby mice were much bigger than others whose mothers had not received the antibody treatment.
The researchers stress that years of testing will be needed to see if it could be a safe and effective treatment for pregnant women.
In the meantime, other scientists are focusing on making a vaccine that could protect people from catching Zika in the first place.
Zika is spread to people by mosquito bites. Outbreaks of the disease have been seen in the Americas and, more recently, in south-east Asia.
Singapore has said its outbreak was caused by a local strain, not the one which caused the huge outbreak in South America.
Prof Laura Rodrigues, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: ""At the moment, if a pregnant woman is diagnosed with Zika she only really has one option - whether or not to have a termination.
""Even if we do one day have a vaccine that can protect people from catching Zika, there will still be some who will get infected.
""For these people, a treatment like this antibody one would be helpful.""
Deaths are rare and only one in five people infected is thought to develop symptoms. These include:
A rare nervous system disorder, Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome, that can cause temporary paralysis has been linked to the infection.
As there is no vaccine or treatment at the moment, the only option is to reduce the risk of being bitten.

Steven Gerrard came close to a late leveller when his free-kick was saved.
While Liverpool roused themselves to apply concerted pressure in the final five minutes, it was not enough to merit an equaliser that would have denied the hosts victory.
Manager Brendan Rodgers returns to Merseyside with more concerns over the disjointed attack and dysfunctional defence that have undermined the start of their Premier League campaign.
Basel themselves looked vulnerable when they were beaten 5-1 by Real Madrid in their Group B opener, and they were cut open inside five minutes by the Reds.
However, Sterling strayed carelessly offside before turning in Lazar Markovic's cross, and Liverpool struggled to create a chance of similar quality for the rest of the match.
Instead full-backs Jose Enrique, preferred at left-back to Alberto Moreno, and Javi Manquillo were frequently exposed as their team were penned back.
Geoffroy Serey Die, exploiting space on Enrique's flank, came closest to scoring in the first half, slamming a shot into goalkeeper Simon Mignolet's shins.
""We'll see what Brendan Rodgers is made of now. They're 14th and nine points away from Chelsea.
""The fans have got to be more realistic. Brendan has to stick to his philosophy and keep believing.
""Mario Balotelli is an individual. The way Suarez and Sterling and Sturridge integrated, it was beautiful.
""Balotelli is a bit of a fixed mannequin and he has to learn the Liverpool way or he'll just be standing there watching.""
While Liverpool looked vulnerable out wide in the first half, it was their deficiencies in the centre of defence that were exposed by the Swiss side's goal.
Skrtel, more concerned with grappling with his man, inadvertently headed the ball against Dejan Lovren and, while Mignolet got down sharply to prevent an own goal, the goalkeeper succeeded only in palming the ball into Streller's path for a simple finish.
Without the injured Daniel Sturridge and the departed Luis Suarez, Liverpool were stripped of the interplay and invention of last season and struggled for a response.
Only Mario Balotelli's long-range free-kick, blocked by goalkeeper Tomas Vaclík's shoulder, and Sterling's clumsy mis-control when clean through gave the home crowd cause for concern.

166,"So read the Nato-Russia Founding Act, signed in Paris in May 1997.
This document - with the Cold War over and the Soviet Union gone - was to have been the start of a new, more constructive relationship.
""Nato and Russia,"" it went on, ""do not consider each other as adversaries.""
Well, how things have changed! While tensions are clearly not at the level of those at the height of the Cold War, they are rising.
Russia's seizure of the Crimea has, in the oft-repeated words of Nato leaders, torn up the play book for security in post-Cold War Europe.
Last week's Nato Summit in Warsaw began the process of sending military reinforcements eastwards, both to reassure worried allies like Poland and the Baltic states, and to send a signal to Moscow that the Alliance would defend the territory of all of its members.
Russia is already crying foul, with Moscow's envoy to Nato Alexander Grushko insisting earlier this week that such troop movements contradict the provisions of the Founding Act.
So Nato and Russia have a lot to talk about on Wednesday In Brussels. Indeed the body that is meeting - the Nato-Russia Council founded in 2002 - was itself a product of the optimism of those early days of Nato-Russia harmony.
It is not just Ukraine though that has soured the relationship.
There was Russia's war with Georgia that in many ways began the rot. And there was the US decision, backed by Nato, to build limited ballistic missile defences in Europe which Moscow insists upon seeing as a precursor to a wider system that could undermine the credibility of its own nuclear deterrent.
But Nato's ""original sin"", as far as Moscow is concerned, was the broader policy of Nato expansion, taking in states such as the Baltic nations whose territory used to be part of the Soviet Union or Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia which used to be among Moscow's Warsaw Pact allies.
Nato now wants to explain its new military deployments to Moscow. It will stress that for now these are small-scale, but more deployments will likely follow unless Russian President Vladimir Putin changes tack.
Nato would prefer dialogue and partnership with Moscow. But it cannot accept Russia's use of force in Ukraine.
It is alarmed too at what it sees as a pattern of irresponsible behaviour on the part of Russian aircraft over the Baltic region and elsewhere, which routinely fly in busy air space with their transponders - or identification beacons - turned off.
If Russia does not like the pattern of stepped-up Nato military exercises established in the wake of the seizure of the Crimea, Nato is alarmed by a whole series of Russian exercises, held at short notice, which are frequently (and wrongly in Nato's view) described by the Russian military as being much smaller than they are to avoid pre-notification or the presence of outside inspectors.
Nato, in a word, wants Russia's behaviour to become more transparent and predictable.
At a time of growing tensions such predictability is a fundamental requirement if incidents or misunderstandings are not to escalate into potential crises.","The Nato-Russia Founding Act, signed in 1997, aimed to establish a new relationship between the two powers after the end of the Cold War. However, tensions have been rising between Nato and Russia, particularly following Russia's seizure of Crimea and its involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. As a result, Nato has been sending military reinforcements to the region to reassure its allies and send a signal to Moscow.

Any reading above 50 indicates growth while a reading below 50 points to a fall in activity.
Markit said the survey pointed to first-quarter economic growth of 0.3%.
That would match the eurozone growth figure for the final three months of 2014.
It said the improvement in business output was the result of growth in new orders that had increased at their fastest rate since 2011.
Employment also grew at its fastest rate since August 2011.
Job creation in the service sector ""held steady"" near February's four year high, Markit said, while in the manufacturing sector it grew at its quickest pace since April last year.
Crucially, the survey showed that deflationary pressures eased in March with prices falling at the slowest rate since July. Markit said this reflected the need for some firms to pass on costs to customers
It added there was some anecdotal evidence that the European Central Bank's (ECB) stimulus measures were beginning to be felt.
Manufacturing prices rose for the first time in seven months, albeit only modestly.
Meanwhile, in the service sector, prices fell, but the rate of decline was the weakest for nine months.
Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey compiler Markit, said the survey results indicated some impetus from the ECB's economic stimulus programme, which began at the start of the month, although it was coming ""at a time when there was already growth"".
He added: ""All the indicators are pointing to a further upturn, firms are taking on staff and it augurs well for the year ahead.""
Separate PMI surveys for Germany and France, the eurozone's two largest economies, were also released.
Business activity in Germany rose to to its highest level in eight months as new orders hit a nine-month record.
German factory output was its highest for nearly a year catching up with the strong pace of growth in the service sector, which hit a six-month high.
The French economy also saw business activity increase for a second month, although at a slightly more modest pace than in February, when it hit a 42-month high.
Business output in France is still running well below that of Germany. However, new orders were at their highest level sine August 2011.
But French manufacturing output fell for the tenth month in row.
Howard Archer chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight called the latest PMI ""highly encouraging"" adding the improvement in manufacturing activity was welcome.
""It is not just the headline figures that are encouraging but the whole tone of the surveys.

172,"Earlier, when an Indian wanted personal advice on life matters - she looked to gurus and astrology. This, in recent times, has been replaced with the English alphabet.
India has more than 20 listed major languages but it is only English which has been bestowed with this honour and whose every letter can be a potential guide to life.
My conjecture is that this has come from management speak. For example, an American restaurant manager will say: ""In the restaurant business years ago, I was taught the three As: acknowledge, apologise, act.""
This obsession with the alphabet is all-pervasive; everyone from the little man on the street to politicians has a pet letter that they split into triple alliteration.
The making of this instant Bible is a wholly arbitrary exercise - zero in on any letter between A and Z, then force it to cough up a minimum of three alliterations.
It can go up from here - it can be five, or seven: the sky is the limit. But the minimum is three. Once you've done this, life becomes much easier.
I recently went to a store selling gym equipment to inquire about buying an exer-cycle. The owner sat glowing behind the counter, his t-shirt sleeves rolled up, his biceps bulging like a buffalo's full udder.
I said to the man: ""I can see you've been doing your body-building in here.""
He said: ""Why not, just like a halwai [sweet vendor] ends up eating his own sweets, I end up exercising in my gym store.""
Then, apropos of nothing, he outlined his life's success mantra for me: ""Food, fashion and fitness.""
He was acting out his life according to the three Fs. Two Fs were already in existence: the store we were in was ""Fitness"", downstairs he had another shop selling readymade clothes - ""fashion"". He whispered he was working on the third ""F"" - food. A ""multi-cuisine restaurant"" with a South Indian, Chinese and Mughlai menu was in the pipeline. His life was set.
Indians cannot have enough of this alphabet soup.
Every commentator and public figure doles out a letter combo in a speech or a column, only to be asked for yet another. It's like Oliver Twist: ""Please, sir, I want some more.""
When it comes to single alphabet combos, Prime Minister Narendra Modi leads from the front.
Two years ago, it was the three Ds of national success: ""Demographic dividend, democracy and demand for goods and services.""
Soon after, President Pranab Mukherjee, addressing both houses of parliament, spoke of  building on ""the 3Ds of democracy, demographic and demand"", and added to it five terrific Ts, riding on the strengths of which would help ""revive Brand India"": ""Tradition, talent, tourism, trade and technology.""
India's film stars also regularly take to Facebook to share their alphabet mantras for success.
Deepika Padukone, the reigning queen of Bollywood, recently seen with Vin Diesel in The Return of Xander Cage, posted this for the benefit of her legion of fans: ""When I was growing up my father said to me, 'To be the best, always remember the three D's - Discipline, Dedication and Determination'."" Total number of ""likes"": 142K.
India's No.1 paperback writer, Chetan Bhagat, recently wrote an op-ed on India's rupee ban for a national broadsheet.
It was headlined, ""The 3 New I's of Indian Politics."" The three inane I's are: ""Intention, Initiative and Ideas.""
Even gurus, not wanting to be left behind, have adapted to changing times. Sri Sri Ravi Shankar tweeted the following three Ps to his followers: ""Perseverance, patience and possibility.""
Among other things, this has led to an intense debate among Indian grammarians about the use of the apostrophe between the chosen key letter and the plural-designating ""s"" that proceeds it.
As always happens, when there's plenty of something, a pioneer emerges who sets the bar higher for everybody who follows.
Naina Dayal, a lecturer in Indian history at St. Stephen's College, Delhi, writes about a University Grants Commission ""Orientation Programme"" that she attended a little while back: ""A former governor spoke to us at length about 14 Cs that we must cherish and impart to our students - confidence, courage, credibility, capability, compassion, concentration, creativity, co-ordination, communication, competence, co-relation, character, culture and commitment.""
When the rest of the country was stuck at three-letter alliterations, this ambitious gentleman - the governor - went where no man had gone before: the fabulous 14.
The trouble with this relentless alphabetising is that there are so many variations possible on a theme (even though the English alphabet is finite), that no one really remembers the mantra after the moment of its utterance has passed.
As a writer, to me, all letters of the alphabet family are equal.
They are my sons, daughters and transgenders. To my mind, it would be terribly unfair on my behalf if I were to throw all my weight around one single letter and the words it subsequently reproduces at random.

It added there could be fresh delays and backlogs in the immigration system if more people tried to enter the UK.
Ministers said it would be ""wrong"" to set out details before exit talks.
The government has confirmed it will seek curbs on free movement rules that currently give EU nationals the right to live and work in other member states.
But it has said it is not possible to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK without a reciprocal pledge from other nations about British nationals living on the continent.
The committee's report said the outcome of the 23 June referendum, in which Britain voted to leave the EU, had placed EU nationals living in the UK ""in a potentially very difficult and uncertain position"".
""Past experience has shown that previous attempts to tighten immigration rules have led to a spike in immigration prior to the rules coming into force,"" the MPs said.
""EU citizens living and working in the UK must be told where they stand in relation to the UK leaving the EU and they should not be used as bargaining chips in the negotiations.""
By Danny Shaw, home affairs correspondent
Every three months, the Home Affairs Committee meticulously documents the progress made by immigration officials in dealing with asylum cases, processing visa applications and removing foreign national offenders.
It's usually a depressing read, with examples of inefficiencies, backlogs and delays.
Today's report is no exception - but with an extra complication.
Britain's looming exit from the European Union raises the possibility of a sudden influx of EU citizens to the UK anxious to claim their right to residence.
If, as the report suggests, a ""cut-off date"" months or two years into the future is identified it's hard to see how a ""surge"" in arrivals can be prevented.
Name a date in the past - 23 June for example - and there'll be howls of protest from those who arrived afterwards.
Dr Swati Dhingra, from the London School of Economics, told BBC 5 live the rise in the national living wage in the UK might encourage people to travel to the country.
She also said if there was a cut-off date ""a lot of people might think, if they want to move to the UK - now is the time"".
The report said the most obvious cut-off period would be the date Article 50 - the formal mechanism to leave the EU - is triggered, or when the UK actually leaves the bloc.
It said the first step to establishing where EU nationals in the UK were living and working was through National Insurance numbers or a system of registration, and the process needed to start quickly.

From Rio
If there is one stadium in this sport that is the natural home to great goals by number 10s in yellow, it is the Maracana, arguably more soulless now but still the scene of glorious memories provided by Pele, Zico and now Brazil's great hope of this World Cup, Neymar.
And 28 minutes into the last-16 game between Colombia and Uruguay, the new poster boy of South American football - and this tournament - put himself alongside Neymar and Argentina's Lionel Messi with a goal to treasure, and one fit for the Maracana.
Media playback is not supported on this device
The 22-year-old showed great awareness to glance over his shoulder to check the positioning of both himself and Uruguay keeper Fernando Muslera even before Abel Aguilar's header came in his direction.
Then came the technique, cushioning the header on his chest while twisting to set up a glorious 25-yard left-foot volley that lost nothing aesthetically by crashing down into the net off the bar.
If Rodriguez had hinted at his potential greatness with goals against Greece,Ivory Coast and Japan in the group stage, this was the moment he joined those other perfect 10s in the World Cup - Messi and Neymar.
He had a Colombian legend to live up to when he took on the mantle of the number 10 - the flamboyant Carlos 'El Pibe' Valderrama, he of the wild hair and glorious talent.
No matter. 'El Nuevo Pibe' - 'The New Kid' - had arrived.
And his arrival made the Maracana forget the man who was not here - Uruguay's Luis Suarez - and his lamentable explanation of how he came to bite Giorgio Chiellini, with both him and his teeth apparently stumbling accidentally into the Italian's shoulder after a loss of balance.
Suarez was present in spirit as Uruguay's fans rose to the siege mentality created by coach Oscar Tabarez with masks, flags and a noisy show of support. The bottom line, however, is after their questionable defence of Suarez in recent days, Uruguay's departure may not be mourned by too many in Brazil outside their own camp.
In some ways, the evidence presented here showed why they were prepared to erect such a dubious apologist shield around Suarez. Without him, they are a shadow of the side they are with him.
Instead, and of a far more savoury nature, the Maracana was the playground of a new world star - and someone who presents a real danger to Brazil when they meet Colombia in their quarter-final in Fortaleza on Friday.
Rodriguez is now the World Cup's top scorer with five goals. While Suarez is back in Uruguay in shame, the smiling Colombian is the fresh and acceptable face of this tournament - and with power to add to his reputation.
Rodriguez could pass for Cristiano Ronaldo's younger brother. He is clean-cut, respectful and was quietly spoken as he dealt with Colombia's adulation after the game.
In the absence of the great goalscorer Radamel Falcao, cruelly deprived of this World Cup by injury, Monaco team-mate Rodriguez was left with a burden he has so far carried with ease.
Jose Luis Alarcon Rojas, of Colombia's RCNR Radio, said: ""Once Falcao was injured, James Rodriguez was the first name in coach Jose Pekerman's selection. He is a young boy who is loved in Colombia, a star.
""No Falcao meant he was more important to Colombia and he has responded to the responsibility. He was always popular but this will make him more popular.""
And what of his meeting with Neymar in Fortaleza?
""Neymar is the young champion of Brazil while James is the young champion of Colombia, but he is our star and he is playing like our star.""
The boy from Cucuta started his career with Envigado in Colombia before, at the tender age of 17, his talent took him to Argentina and Banfield.
After winning the Primera Division, he moved to Porto, helping them secure three titles and the Europa League.
Last summer he joined Monaco for £38.5m, but goals like those against Uruguay, and his second was also a thing of beauty in a team context, will be attracting the attention of others who may wish to prise him away from the Principality.
When he was told Tabarez had mentioned his name in a list that included Argentina great Diego Maradona, Messi and Suarez, he said: ""It is always a matter of great pride that someone like him has said these things. All I want to do is help the team.""
A player of balance, nurtured by the wise Pekerman, who has placed great trust in him, he has the ability to contribute to the team ethic, as proved by his second goal, while demonstrating great individual virtuosity.
As his goal was replayed on the Maracana's big screens, gasps of appreciation swirled around the stadium. It was his shirt and his name that could be seen and heard as elated Colombians celebrated in the streets snaking away from the Copacabana on Saturday night.
Colombia may have lived in the shadow of the South American superpowers such as Brazil and Argentina in the past. In Rodriguez they have a player who can help them step into the light - starting in Fortaleza on Friday.","The article discusses the second goal scored by James Rodriguez of Colombia against Uruguay in the World Cup match.

He departed Palace the next day, on 14 August, on the eve of the new season.
Pulis said his reason for asking for the bonus early was due to an imminent purchase of land for his children and he ""urgently needed the money"" to enable that, the arbitration tribunal heard.
And he said had decided to leave the club as a result of a ""heated"" players' meeting on 12 August but the panel rejected that claim, with the judgement saying the meeting had actually happened on 8 August.
""Since the panel has concluded that the heated players' meeting occurred on 8 August, Mr Pulis's explanation for his sudden desire to leave the club cannot be true. There must therefore be another reason,"" it said.
The ruling also said: ""There was in truth no pressing need for the money at all, since at no time was there a plot of land on the market which Mr Pulis was remotely close to purchasing.""
The panel concluded it was satisfied Pulis intended to give the club the ""false impression"" he had a pressing need for the money for the land purchase and that ""he knew or was reckless to the fact that the impression he was giving to the club was a false one"".
""His motive in doing so was to secure early payment of £2m,"" the tribunal panel said.
Pulis had said he only wanted to leave if it was ""mutually agreeable for him to leave on the eve of the new season"", and that it had been ""mutually agreeable"".
He also said he was ""committed"" to the club.
But the panel disputed that, saying he had not told the truth and had ""deliberately misled"" Palace chairman Steve Parish.
Palace bosses gave Pulis the £2m on 12 August and the day after ""he dropped the bombshell on the club"" leaving them ""in the lurch"".
""By any standards his conduct [prior to and during the litigation] has been shown to be disgraceful,"" the panel said.
A spokeswoman for Crystal Palace told BBC News the club would not be making any comment on the ruling.
Pulis, who managed Stoke City from 2006 to 2013, became manager of West Brom in January 2015.",A Premier League Managers' Arbitration Tribunal ruled that Pulis should pay £3.7m damages to Crystal Palace in a dispute about the way he left the club at the start of the 2014-15 season. The tribunal found that Pulis had deliberately misled Palace chairman Steve Parish and had not told the truth about his reasons for leaving the club. The panel concluded that Pulis's motive in doing so was to secure early payment of £2m.</s>,mistral7b,XSUM,

184,"The spread of non-native species threatens livelihoods and biodiversity, but the issue is worsened by global trade, travel and climate change.
Writing in Nature Communications journal, and international team forecast how the spread of species could change over the 21st Century.
They show that one-sixth of the world's land surface is vulnerable to invasion.
In what the authors say is the first evaluation of its kind, the paper assesses individual nations' abilities to manage existing invasive species and respond to new ones.
Regan Early from the University of Exeter, Jeffrey Dukes from Purdue University in the US and other co-authors suggest that developed countries, which have been most affected by invasive species - and have the strongest management efforts - will continue to face an onslaught of new arrivals.
However, they predict that non-native plants, animals and microbes will increasingly threaten developing countries with some of the last remaining biodiversity hotspots, due to increased air travel and the expansion of agriculture.
This could endanger livelihoods and food security in fragile economies that are ill-prepared to deal with the expansion of invasive organisms.
Dr Early commented: ""Rampant globalisation will lead to invasions in countries with the least capability to deal with them.
""We need more international cooperation, and the US, Australia and nations in Europe to share expertise.""
Prof Dukes added: ""Low-income countries stand to lose a lot by having their natural resources sapped by invasive species.
""We hope this analysis can be a conversation starter for governments around the world to strengthen their protection.""
Invasive species often travel as stowaways or contaminants in goods imported by planes and ships. They also arrive as exotic pets or plants that subsequently escape or are released deliberately into the wild.
This can pose challenges native species that have evolved over thousands of years to be well adapted to their ecosystems. Consequently, new arrivals can quickly change the nature of a whole region and often outcompete native organisms for resources and habitat.
Burmese pythons originally arrived in the US as exotic pets, but they escaped and quickly established themselves in the Florida Everglades, where they have contributed to a catastrophic decline in native mammals.
In Europe, forests and woods have been transformed by introduced diseases and pests such as Dutch elm disease and Ash dieback.
""You can think of invasive species as biological pollution - a self-replicating change,"" said Prof Dukes.
""It doesn't take much effort or intention to bring in an invasive species that then wreaks havoc on a landscape.""
Biological invasions in the developing world so far have included influxes of Diamondback moths, which can devastate broccoli, cabbage and other crops; Panama disease, which wiped out banana plantations in central and south America; and prickly pear, which devastated grassland in Africa, leading to cattle being malnourished.","The spread of non-native species poses a threat to livelihoods and biodiversity, and is worsened by global trade, travel and climate change.

But she was chosen ahead of four women who had recorded faster times.
""I feel it was a really brave decision. I am absolutely determined not to let them down,"" said the 21-year-old.
""I'm absolutetly delighted that the selectors have had faith in me.

""They have looked at my recent form and decided I was the one to go with for the Olympics.""
Sharp ran a personal best in winning the silver medal at the European Championships but failed to make the 'A' qualifying time by 0.62 seconds.
Her inclusion in Team GB could yet be challenged, with head coach Charles van Commenee admitting he is bracing himself for a ""heap of appeals"" from athletes in a variety of disciplines after Tuesday's announcement.
However, Jenny Meadows, the 2009 world bronze medallist and a former European 800m bronze medallist, now says she will not appeal despite previously threatening to do so.
Marilyn Okoro and Emma Jackson have also run the 'A' standard this year but finished fifth and seventh respectively at the Olympic trials won by Sharp.
Jemma Simpson competed in Helsinki but finished seventh in the final behind the Scot, while Meadows was forced to pull out before her European Championships race after aggravating an Achilles injury.
International rules mean an athlete who has achieved the 'B' standard can only be selected if there are no 'A' standard athletes in that event selected to the team.
Van Commenee revealed that two of the six hours spent making the selections were spent on the 800m women and that they had decided to go with the woman on form.
""I feel bad about those athletes who have missed out,"" said Sharp. ""I know I don't need to, but I can't help it.
""But I won the trials and I got a silver medal at the European and ran a PB when I was there, so clearly I am in great form and I've beaten all the girls that were in the picture, so I guess that's what the selectors have looked at and I'm really grateful for that.""
Sharp follows in the footsteps of a famous parent, sprinter Cameron having competed at the 1980 Moscow Games.
""My dad got a silver at the Europeans and I got a silver at the Europeans at the weekend,"" she told BBC Scotland.
""So it is really nice that I am following in his footsteps. He was 21 when he went to the Olympics and I am 21 now, so it's really special.""
The 21-year-old McColgan, who won the 3000m steeplechase at the same event, follows in the footsteps of her mother, Liz, the former 10,000m world champion who won silver at the 1988 Games in Seoul.
Child, 25, qualified for the team after a second-place finish at the Aviva 2012 Trials in Birmingham, a stumble at the final hurdle allowing English rival Perri Shakes-Drayton to win.
McConnell also had not achieved the 'A' standard in the individual 400m but was delighted to be one of Van Commenee's three discretionary picks.
""I was always confident about the relay place but was pleasantly surprised to get the pick for the individual,"" said the 33-year-old.
""To go to one Olympics is very special, but with this one being in London, I just didn't want to miss out on it.""

188,"First published in 1840, The Tablet is the second oldest surviving weekly journal in the UK, after The Spectator.
The Mass, led by the Archbishop of Cardiff, George Stack, will begin at 14:00 BST.
It will feature the world premiere of a special commission by classical composer Roxanna Panufnik.
Literary editor Brendan Walsh told the BBC: ""We're expecting a memorable liturgical occasion and a lovely party.""
With readers invited to join the editor, staff and contributors for the Mass and for a reception afterwards, he added: ""The Tablet is a friendly, exuberant, sometimes rumbustious family, with a close bond between its readers and its editors and writers, and the journal has always stood for a respectful, lively and open conversation in the household of the faith.""
The Tablet is far older than Westminster Cathedral itself, the Roman Catholics' mother church in England and Wales, which first opened its doors to the public in 1903.
Founded more than 60 years earlier, in the year that Queen Victoria married Prince Albert and the Penny Black stamp was first used, the magazine was set up by Frederick Lucas, a Quaker convert to Catholicism.
The journal has covered the reigns of 13 Popes in the years since, with writers Evelyn Waugh and Graham Greene among its contributors.
Its aim at the time was to record the news of interest to a Catholic population that was growing fast, thanks partly to immigration from Ireland - with the number of Catholics in England rising from around 80,000 in 1770 to 750,000 in 1850.
Parliament had recently passed the Roman Catholic Relief Act in 1829, giving Roman Catholics the right to vote and hold most public offices.
However, by the 20th Century, the journal's liberal stance on contraception in the 1960s apparently brought ""sorrow and disappointment"" to Pope Paul VI.
Today, there are more than five million Catholics in the UK, and the journal remains the voice of much of the laity.
In recent years its pages have included contributions from figures such as former Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, the journalist John Cornwell and concert pianist Stephen Hough.
Celebrating its birthday edition with a list of the Top 100 lay Catholics of 2015, the magazine placed Bank of England governor Mark Carney in first place.
Editor Catherine Pepinster says the magazine's longevity - despite the tempestuous history of Roman Catholicism here - is testimony to the capacity for minority groups to thrive in Britain.","The Tablet, founded in 1840, is the second oldest surviving weekly journal in the UK.

The unusual case was diagnosed through a collaboration between the US Centers for Disease Control and the UK's Natural History Museum.
Doctors said the case, detailed in the New England Journal of Medicine, was ""crazy"" and unusual.
Colombian doctors had tried to diagnose the 41-year-old man in 2013.
He had what appeared to be normal tumours, some more than 4 cm across, in his lungs, liver and elsewhere in his body.
But on closer inspection the cancerous cells were clearly not human - they were tiny at just a tenth of the size of a human cell.
""It didn't really make sense,"" said Dr Atis Muehlenbachs, who picked up the ""crazy"" case at the US Centers of Disease Control.
He ran through several theories including shrinking human cancer cells or even a newly discovered infection.
Eventually, molecular testing identified high levels of tapeworm DNA in the tumours and the reaction was ""complete disbelief"" from Dr Muehlenbachs.
He told the BBC News website: ""This has been the most unusual case, it caused many sleepless nights.
""It should have been obvious this was cancer or an infection and not being able to tell between the two for months is unusual.""
The patient was too sick to treat by the time doctors were able to identify the cause of his tumours.
He died, in Medellin in Colombia, three days after the worm DNA was discovered.
The worm tissue in question came from dwarf tapeworm - Hymenolepis nana - a specialism of Dr Peter Olson from the Natural History Museum.
""There is something very special about this species,"" he told the BBC, ""It is able to carry out its whole lifecycle in one host and that is absolutely unique.""
Around 90% of the worm's body is given over to reproduction as it spews out thousands of eggs into the gut every day.
Rather than the worm getting cancer, it is thought one of these eggs penetrated the lining of the intestines, mutated and ultimately became cancerous.
""They were dividing and proliferating out of control and that is really what defines a cancer so they had a tape worm tumour,"" Dr Olson said.
Up to 75 million people have an H. nana infection at any one time.
Doctors believe that worm-cancer is rare, but know many cases could be going undiagnosed.

There have been some cases of cancers going from one person to another through organ transplant or in the womb.
Another cancer, this time in dogs, has been spread from canine to canine for 11,000 years.
Prof Mel Greaves, the director of the centre for evolution and cancer at The Institute of Cancer Research in London, said the latest case was ""interesting and unique"".
He told the BBC News website: ""What is extraordinary is that it is free cells of the parasite growing and in a cancer-like fashion rather than whole tapeworms.
""Species from almost all invertebrate phyla can develop cancer and the potential seems inherent to animal cells, and particularly the stem cells of multicellular animals.
""What has transpired in this case is that an exceptional combination of circumstances permitted this potential to be expressed in a very foreign host.""

Radio 4's You and Yours has been told once the compulsory amount is imposed, Judges feel there is less available for victim compensation orders.
The Ministry of Justice said the charge should not affect payments to victims.
When announced the government said the fee would be paid on top of fines, compensation orders and defendants' own legal charges.
But in one GBH prosecution at Leeds Crown Court on August 19, Judge Christopher Batty outlined the impact of the new charge while setting a compensation order for a victim who had suffered three broken ribs and a punctured lung  in an attack at a party in Castleford, West Yorkshire.
Setting a compensation order of £500, the judge said it was not possible to impose a higher amount because he had been obliged to impose the Criminal Courts Charge.
Court reporter Olwen Dudgeon told the programme: ""He was clearly unhappy that he couldn't award the amount he would have liked to have done.""
She said the charge had also had an impact during the prosecution of Andrew Shires, 37, of Holmfirth, who pleaded guilty at Leeds Crown Court to unlawfully wounding Chloe Knapton when he threw a vodka bottle through her car window.
The 21-year-old dancer suffered facial scars.
Ms Dudgeon said: ""The Recorder Peter Babb made the £900 Criminal Courts Charge and knowing the defendant didn't have much money available said it's not possible to consider compensation -  so again because £900 went on the Criminal Courts Charge she didn't get a penny in compensation.""
The Magistrates' Association has warned the new charge could place a burden on people with little income.
It also suggested innocent people could be encouraged to plead guilty to avoid the risk of higher payments, as those who admit their offences will pay less than those convicted after a trial.
The government said the new charge would be reviewed three years after implementation, but the Magistrates' Association said it should be reviewed after six months.
President of the Law Society, Jonathan Smithers, said: ""There are cases because of this change in policy where people are losing out, the victims who would otherwise have received compensation are not receiving it.
""Compensation orders are important because the criminal injuries compensation scheme is limited. This is a way for the judge to say 'you should have this without any further evidence'.""
A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""It is right that convicted adult offenders who use our criminal courts should pay towards the cost of running them.
""We have always made it absolutely clear that offenders must pay compensation orders, victims surcharge and fines before the criminal court charge.

The move comes after Iran resolved to reduce ties following the UK's decision to impose further sanctions on it.
Iran expressed ""regret"" over the attack on the embassy. The Foreign Office has summoned an Iranian diplomat in London.
British Prime Minister David Cameron said: ""The attack on the British embassy in Tehran today was outrageous and indefensible.""
After a series of ups and downs in relations following the 1979 Iranian revolution, London and Tehran restored full diplomatic ties in 1988.
Iran broke off relations the following year after Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwa on the author Salman Rushdie. Partial diplomatic relations were restored in 1990 and these were upgraded in 1999 to ambassadorial level.
In 2001, UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw visited Iran.
In March 2007, Iranian forces seized eight Royal Navy sailors and seven marines from their patrol boat on the border between Iran and Iraq, saying that the sailors had entered Iranian waters. They were freed the next month.
In June 2009, Britain froze Iranian assets worth almost Â£1bn under sanctions imposed over Iran's nuclear programme, and later Iran and Britain each expelled two diplomats. The same month, Iran accused Britain of involvement in the post-presidential election unrest in Iran.
In November 2011, Britain imposed new financial sanctions on Iran, a move which appears to have led to the current situation.
UK's Tehran fortress falls to rising Iranian ire
He said those responsible for the attack must be prosecuted.
""I spoke to our Ambassador this afternoon and was reassured that everyone has been accounted for,"" Mr Cameron added.
UK Foreign Secretary Hague said the Iranian charge d'affaires had been summoned, adding: ""Clearly there will be other, further, and serious consequences.""
The Foreign Office urged Britons in Iran to ""stay indoors, keep a low profile and await further advice"".
The Iranian Foreign Ministry expressed ""regret for certain unacceptable behaviour by a small number of protesters in spite of efforts by the police"".
""The relevant authorities have been asked to take the necessary measures and look into this issue immediately,"" it said.
The students clashed with riot police and chanted ""the embassy of Britain should be taken over"" and ""death to England"".
Students were said to have ransacked offices inside the building, and one protester was reported to be waving a framed picture of Queen Elizabeth II.
Iran's semi-official Mehr news agency said embassy documents had been set alight. Staff fled by the back door, the agency added.
Pictures showed a car inside the compound on fire while several hundred other demonstrators were gathered outside the embassy's walls.
A separate group of protesters also broke into another British embassy compound in the north of the city, the UK Foreign Office confirmed. It was not clear how much damage was done there.
After about two hours, police were back in control of the main embassy building. Live TV footage showed riot police removing protesters.
Security forces fired tear gas, the semi-official Fars news agency reported. It said some protesters and police had been injured in the clash.
In pictures: Iran embassy protest
Eventually, both compounds were cleared, Iranian media reported.
There was strong international reaction to Tuesday's events.
The 15-nation UN Security Council - which has passed four rounds of sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme - condemned the attack ""in the strongest terms"".
US President Barack Obama said he was ""deeply disturbed"" by events in Tehran.
""I strongly urge the Iranian government to hold those responsible to task,"" he added.
Germany also summoned its Iranian ambassador over the storming of the British embassy - in which a German school was also damaged.
Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle called it ""a violation of international law"".
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said ""the Iranian regime has shown what little consideration it has for international law"".
Russia said the attack was ""unacceptable"".
Last week the US, UK and Canada announced new measures targeting Iran over its controversial nuclear plans.
For its part, the UK Treasury imposed sanctions on Iranian banks, accusing them of facilitating the country's nuclear programme
That decision followed a report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that suggested Iran was working towards acquiring a nuclear weapon.
It said Iran had carried out tests ""relevant to the development of a nuclear device"".
Iran insists its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes only.
On Sunday, Iran's parliament voted by a large majority to downgrade diplomatic relations with the UK in response to the British action.

The arrest of Olympic Council of Ireland president Pat Hickey made headlines around the world.
The former judo international has denied any wrongdoing in relation to ticket sales, and is due to appear before a judge in Rio on Tuesday.
Here is how events have unfolded:
Friday 5 August:
On the day of the Olympics opening ceremony, Rio police arrest Kevin Mallon, director of THG Sports, a corporate and sports hospitality company based in London.
More than 700 tickets organised in envelopes clearly marked for sale are found in a safe with Mr Mallon, police said.
Wednesday 10 August:
In an email seen by RTE News, Pro 10 Sports Management, the OCI's authorised ticket re-seller in Ireland informs the organisers of the Rio games that:
""At no time did we authorise Mr Mallon to sell any tickets on our behalf nor to the best of our knowledge did he sell any tickets. He merely acted as a collection point for individuals transacting directly with ourselves.""
The OCI says it is launching an immediate investigation, adding that it ""strictly adheres to the International Olympic Committee regulations around ticket allocation, sale and re-sale"".
""We are treating this matter with the utmost seriousness,"" it says.
Sunday 14 August:
Irish Sports Minister Shane Ross arrives in Rio for a meeting with Pat Hickey.
Mr Ross describes the meeting as ""fairly tense, fairly direct and fairly frank"", and calls for an independent investigation.
Mr Hickey says the meeting was ""excellent"".
Monday 15 August:
A Brazilian judge orders the arrest of four THG Sports executives.
Marcus Evans and Martin Studd from the UK, Irishman David Patrick Gilmore and Dutchman Maarten Van Os are not believed to be in Brazil.
Police say they will be pursuing the matter via Interpol.
Wednesday 17 August:
Pat Hickey is dramatically arrested by police at his luxury hotel. His Olympic credentials and passport are seized.
Mr Hickey complains of a heart problem and spends a night in hospital.
Thursday 18 August:
Pat Hickey temporarily stands down from his positions as president of the OCI, president of the European Olympic Committees and member of the executive board of the International Olympic Committee.
The OCI says in a statement that Mr Hickey is stepping aside ""until this matter is fully resolved"" and would continue to co-operate and assist with all inquiries.
Acting OCI President William O'Brien says the council will ""defend ourselves to the hilt"".
Mr Hickey is questioned by police, denied bail by a judge and sent to Rio's notorious Bangu 10 prison.

The OCI announces it will commission an independent inquiry into Olympics ticketing.
Saturday 20 August:
Pat Hickey and Kevin Mallon are reported to be sharing a cell in Bangu prison.

199,"""I'm not that interested in costume drama,"" says James Brining, artistic director of the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds, discussing the theatre's Bronte season.
You might think being interested in costume drama would be an essential requirement for putting on a season dedicated to the Bronte sisters, whose stage and screen adaptations are rarely without a full set of bodices and bonnets.
But Brining says he wants to ""look at the Brontes from as many different perspectives as possible"" to explore what they and their stories mean today.
So, in that spirit, a futuristic stage adaptation of Charlotte's final novel Villette catapults the action from 1853 to circa 2216, with the heroine Lucy Snowe depicted as a clone.
Meanwhile, a rock musical about the Brontes, composed by one of the people behind the Olivier Award-winning Showstopper!, is being staged in Leeds as a work in progress.
And there is an audio drama, intended to be listened to outside the former family home in Haworth, 20 miles away, about an estate agent who has fled London after an affair to seek solace in Bronte country.
The season is being staged to mark the 200th anniversary of Charlotte's birth.
One hundred and sixty three years ago, Charlotte published Villette, about a solitary young woman trying to find her place in the world, who gives away little of her intense inner self.
""It is about a woman who is invisible,"" says writer Linda Marshall Griffiths, who has adapted it for the stage.
""A Victorian, unmarried woman, who is thought to be useless in society, and yet she had this vibrant imagination, a fierce mind and an extraordinary voice. And that seemed to be a story that's worth telling now.""
In the new West Yorkshire Playhouse version, Lucy is no longer an unassuming Victorian woman - she is a clone who has survived a viral pandemic.
""We could have done bonnets,"" Marshall Griffiths says. ""But when you're adapting or reimagining something, it's worth thinking about how this book can speak to us. Sometimes if you jump into the future it can speak back to us about who we are now.""
On Thursday, the West Yorkshire Playhouse will host a debate about which is Charlotte's greatest work - Villette or her more famous debut novel Jane Eyre. Marshall Griffiths, unsurprisingly, votes Villette.
""I think Jane Eyre is all there in Villette, but there's no part of her heart or guts that aren't in Villette,"" she says. ""Also the extraordinary language - it's really potent, deep, poetic, really brilliant stuff.
""It's a harder read but you've got to stick with it. It's such a deep book and there's so much that it's so rich and surprising. It makes my hair stand up when I read it sometimes. It's electrifying.""
Charlotte Bronte wrote Villette in the wake of the deaths of her sisters Emily and Anne and brother Branwell.
A sense of loneliness and loss hangs over the central character, but Charlotte was advised against explaining the absence of Lucy Snowe's family because it was thought to have been too autobiographical.
But in the stage version, Lucy is given two sisters - also clones, naturally, named Esme and Ash - who were killed by the virus.
""They haunt the whole play, in the way I think Emily and Anne haunt Villette,"" Marshall Griffiths says. ""At the heart of Villette it's about someone moving from being totally and utterly devastated back into life.
""It speaks so much about where we're at now because it speaks about what it means to be an outsider - and that for women and for all those people who are outsiders, the journey back in is possible.""
The Bronte musical, titled Wasted, is a very different sort of show - but it too tackles Charlotte's reaction to the deaths of her siblings.
Wasted will be set in the 19th Century, will tell the story of the family themselves - and will feature actors in bonnets. But it is far from a traditional period retelling.
One song sees Charlotte howling over a grungy guitar: ""Why go on writing words in books when the truth is - everybody dies?""
The music is composed by Carl Miller and Christopher Ash, founding member of improvised musical Showstopper!.
""They had really quite difficult lives and there's a lot of strife and struggle going on in their story,"" Ash says. ""The first song that we wrote was called Everybody Dies for Charlotte because she outlives the other three. All of this pain - that's a place to sing rock from.""
The show already has one influential fan - it has won the musical theatre award and a Â£10,000 grant from the Kevin Spacey Foundation.
Although there will be bonnets, the volume of ""passion and energy"" in the Brontes' lives means it will not seem out of place when the sisters open their mouths and rock anthems come out, Ash believes.
The show's musical style has an ""experimental edge"" in an attempt to do justice to the sisters' groundbreaking work, he adds.
""There's straight rock but also really extreme grindcore, synth-pop and jazz-rock with interesting time signatures.
""There are some nods to more traditional musical theatre things, but when people come and see it, we really want them to feel like they're at some level at a gig. We really want to mix those worlds.""
Fans of gentle costume drama have been warned.
Villette is at the West Yorkshire Playhouse until 15 October. Wasted is on from 20-22 October.

But the 27-year-old Davies, who wears a scrum cap, believes ""fierce"" collisions mean ""bangs"" are inevitable.

Public Health England says in some cases patients will have no symptoms, but the infection can cause serious bloodstream and wound infections.
So far, no UK patient has died from it.
The first UK case emerged in 2013. Since then, infection rates have been going up - although it remains rare.
Candida auris is proving hard to stop because it has developed some resistance to the drug doctors normally use against it.
As of July, 20 separate NHS trusts and independent hospitals in the UK had detected Candida auris.
More than 35 other hospitals have had patients known to be colonised with Candida auris transferred to them.
Three hospitals have seen large outbreaks that have been difficult to control, despite intensive infection prevention and control measures.
These outbreaks have now been declared over, however, Public Health England says.
Dr Colin Brown, from Public Health England's national infection service, said most of the UK cases had been detected by screening, rather than investigations for patients with symptoms. But 27 patients have developed bloodstream infections.
""Our enhanced surveillance shows a low risk to patients in healthcare settings. Most cases detected have not shown symptoms or developed an infection as a result of the fungus.
""NHS hospitals that have experienced outbreaks of Candida auris have not found it to be the cause of death in any patients.""
He said PHE had updated its infection-control guidance for hospitals and nursing homes on managing outbreaks of Candida auris, together with a leaflet for patients who may have the fungal infection.
What is Candida auris?
It belongs to a family of fungi or yeasts that live on the skin and inside the human body.
A more common ""cousin"" in this family is Candida albicans, which causes the yeast infection thrush.
Candida auris was first identified in 2009 in a patient from Japan.
Hospital outbreaks have since been reported in the United States, India, Pakistan, Venezuela, Colombia, Israel, Oman, South Africa and Spain, as well as the UK.
Some people can carry the infection without having any symptoms or being unwell.
Patients in hospital who catch it may become sick, although infections are still usually minor.
Candida auris can cause more serious bloodstream and wound infections, however.
Nursing staff can take swabs from different parts of a patient's body to check if Candida auris is present.
That is still being investigated, but experts think it is spread by contact from person to person, on people's hands, clothing or on bits of medical equipment.
Contamination is quick - several hospitals have reported it takes as little as four hours from initial exposure.
Spread can be limited by good hygiene - keeping hands clean by frequent hand washing and using alcohol gel.
If a patient in hospital is found to be infected, their visitors may be asked to wear a gown, plastic aprons and gloves.
Antifungal medicines can treat the infection, despite the strain of Candida auris in the UK having some resistance to some of these drugs.
A biosafety Investigation Unit at Porton Down, the government's military research base, is testing a variety of disinfectants and antiseptics to see if they can kill the infection.","Candida auris is a fungus that can cause serious bloodstream and wound infections in some cases, but usually causes minor infections. It is spread by contact from person to person and can be limited by good hygiene. Hospitals in the UK are on the lookout for further cases and have put measures in place to control any spread. The first UK case emerged in 2013 and infection rates have been going up, although it remains rare. Candida auris has developed some resistance to the drug doctors normally use against it. Three hospitals have seen large outbreaks that have been difficult to control, despite intensive infection prevention and control measures. These outbreaks have now been declared over. Public Health England has updated its infection-control guidance for hospitals and nursing homes on managing outbreaks of Candida auris, together with a leaflet for patients who may have the fungal infection.</s>",mistral7b,XSUM,

PR officers beam at you through tightly gritted teeth, chief executives look thoroughly bored as they move reluctantly from one media engagement to another - six minutes for each interview and not a second more, or their sharp-suited minders get very unhappy

In pictures: Bugatti's Chiron leads the pack at Geneva
How can you improve upon 'automotive perfection'?
Supercars set to roar off the block
Just getting to the show is a major logistical challenge. Flights are booked up, the most affordable hotels sell out a year in advance, and the remainder would challenge the budget of a minor millionaire.
The traffic is best described as the worst advert for the car industry you could possibly imagine. And you've probably heard that in Switzerland the trains always run on time. Not during the show they don't - mine was 19 minutes late on Thursday.
Inside the show itself, you're faced with an array of the most advanced automotive engineering money can buy - but in many ways the mentality of the industry is entrenched in the 1960s.
Sex sells may be an outdated and discredited mantra, but the people here clearly didn't get the memo.
It's as though there's an unbreakable rule, written in engine oil that states: every car model must without fail be flanked by a human version, every bit as sleek and polished as the machine itself.
They're all female of course, and all wearing clothes which must make simply getting dressed a striking achievement. The message is simple. Get the car and you'll get the girl. I say, good luck with that....
I spoke to some of these women and I learned two things. Smiling for too long can give you toothache, and standing for hours in high heels really hurts. Forget the glamour, feel the pain.
But despite all that - I said I quite like the Geneva show and I do. That's because it is here on neutral ground, away from the home bases of the big auto giants, that you see some of the most interesting cars in the world.
There's the big-bucks Bugatti Chiron, which is, almost as powerful as two Formula One cars combined.
The EV3, a quirky electric three-wheeler from British manufacturer Morgan, with state of the art technology in a car that looks like something out of the 1930s.
Or there's the Rinspeed Etos, which has a drone on the back because the engineer who designed it just thought it would be good fun.
The point is that here in Geneva it isn't all about business. The car really is the star of the show.","The Geneva Motor Show is a chaotic event filled with frenetic activity, missed schedules and carefully planned arrangements that fall apart as soon as the doors open.

209,"Their manager informed them he had secured a recording contract with a subsidiary of EMI Records, and they should return home for their initial recording session.
It wasn't true.
In fact, all Brian Epstein had secured was an audition with producer George Martin who was, at that time, best known for making comedy records with Peter Sellers and Bernard Cribbins.
Furthermore, Martin himself was sceptical of the band's chances.
""I wasn't too impressed with the tape Brian Epstein had played me,"" he told Desert Island Discs in 1996. ""There was something there but I couldn't find out whether it was worthwhile or not.
""What I said to Brian was, 'if you want me to judge them on what you're playing me, I'm sorry, I'll have to turn you down.'
""He was so disappointed. I felt really sorry for him, actually because he was such an earnest young man. So I gave him a lifeline. I said, 'If you want to bring them down from Liverpool, I'll give them an hour in the studio.'""
The band duly set up in Studio Three at Abbey Road on the afternoon of 6 June, 1962 but their road-worn instruments initially caused some problems. Worst of all was Paul McCartney's amp, which was distorting so badly that engineers had to wheel up a vast replacement speaker from EMI's echo chamber.
""I got nothing out of The Beatles' equipment except for a load of noise, hum and goodness-knows-what,"" engineer Norman Smith later told Sound On Sound.
Problems solved, the band launched into their first song - a cover of Consuelo Velazquez's bolero ballad Besame Mucho (Kiss Me A Lot) - at around 19:00.
It failed to impress.
""I remember Martin taking a quick look at them and leaving for tea,"" said sound engineer Ken Townsend.
But when the band launched into their next track, Lennon and McCartney's Love Me Do, tape engineer Chris Neal was sent scurrying down to the Abbey Road canteen to grab his boss.
He arrived and took over the session, although he was still unconvinced.
""I thought their music was rubbish,"" he told the BBC's Arena programme in 2011.
""I couldn't really make out for myself what I was listening for - because I was so conditioned to [hearing] a solo singer with a backing group. But here I had four people who were all doing all sorts of things.
""It wasn't Cliff Richard and the Shadows, that's for sure.""
The band went on to record two more numbers - P.S. I Love You and Ask Me Why - before the session ended around 22:00.
Martin invited the band back to the control room and explained, at great length, where he felt they were going wrong.
""We gave them a long lecture about their equipment and what would have to be done about it if they were to become recording artists,"" recalled Norman Smith.
In particular, Martin focused on Pete Best's drumming, explaining that what worked on stage at Liverpool's Cavern Club wasn't appropriate in the studio.
Best was sacked and replaced by Ringo Starr as a result (although even he wasn't permitted to play on the later, finished version of Love Me Do - that was done by Scots session drummer Andy White, who died last year).
Best's mother was furious, and phoned Martin to complain. She later told Liverpudlian journalist Bill Harry (who covered The Beatles' rise to fame for the Mersey Beat newspaper) that the producer had been taken aback by the band's decision.
""I never suggested that Pete Best must go,"" she reported him as saying. ""All I said was that, for the purposes of The Beatles' first record, I would rather use a session man. I never thought Brian Epstein would let him go. He seemed to be the most saleable commodity as far as looks went.""
Back at Abbey Road, Martin gave The Beatles the chance to respond to his dressing down. ""I've laid into you for quite a long time,"" he said. ""You haven't responded. Is there anything you don't like?""
""Well, for a start,"" replied George Harrison, ""I don't like your tie.""
The quip broke the ice and The Beatles relaxed into comedy mode.
""For the next 15 to 20 minutes they were pure entertainment,"" recalled Norman Smith. ""I had tears running down my face.""
Despite his misgivings, Martin eventually decided The Beatles had ""the potential to make a hit record"" and gave them a recording deal on 6 June (backdated by two days so as to secure copyright to the recording session).
He later admitted it was their ""tremendous charisma"" rather than their music that won him over.
""When you are with them, you are all the better for being with them and when they leave you feel a loss,"" he told Sue Lawley.
""I fell in love with them. It's as simple as that.""","The document discusses the initial recording session of The Beatles with George Martin at Abbey Road Studios on 6 June 1962.

More controversial reforms, including phasing out early retirement and tax rises for farmers, have been pushed back until August.
With talks on the bailout now under way, Mr Tsipras said he would hold a special congress on Syriza's future, likely to be in early September once the negotiations have wrapped up.

There has been no confirmation from Sony Pictures that the actor will be the next 007.

212,"Last week North Korea appeared to back down from a threat to send missiles towards the US Pacific island of Guam, but said it would watch US actions.
It has already condemned these drills as pouring ""gasoline on fire"".
Washington describes the drills as defensive in nature, but the North sees them as preparation for invasion.
China and Russia had in July proposed a halt on military exercises in exchange for a freeze on missile tests.
But Joseph Dunford, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said last week that the military exercises were ""not currently on the table as part of the negotiation at any level"" and the Ulchi-Freedom Guardian (UFG) exercises were going ahead as planned.
About 17,500 US troops and 50,000 South Korean troops are involved in the exercises, which will last for about 10 days.
After North Korea's threats against Guam and an almost unprecedented war of words over Pyongyang's repeated missile tests, analysts have warned that the joint drills may be seen as a provocation at a particularly sensitive time.
On Sunday an editorial in North Korea's official government newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, said the exercises would worsen the state of the peninsula and warned of an ""uncontrollable phase of a nuclear war"".
South Korea's President Moon Jae-in responded on Monday that Pyongyang should not use the exercises ""as a pretext for aggravating the situation"", reported Yonhap news agency.
The drills have also been met with some opposition in South Korea, where protests were held on Monday.
The US and South Korea hold two sets of war games every year, involving a massive number of troops and military hardware.
Foal Eagle/Key Resolve is usually held in spring, while Ulchi-Freedom Guardian (UFG) is in autumn.
Both involve land, sea and air military drills and computer simulations. Held in South Korea, they have also involved practice drills for terror and chemical attacks in recent years.
They can also sometimes involve troops from other allies - last year's UFG saw the participation of nine other countries.
Both events routinely anger North Korea, which insists that the exercises are rehearsals for an invasion.
The country's media rhetoric over the drills has steadily intensified over the past three years and these exercises are being portrayed as a particularly strong provocation, BBC Monitoring reports.
In 2014 North Korean media warned of an arms race but used comparatively restrained language, saying Pyongyang's ""self-defensive measures"" - its nuclear and missile testing - would become ""annual and regular"" as long as the exercises continued.
The next year, state-run Rodong Sinmun newspaper warned that the drills represented ""deliberate defiance against our active efforts to ease tension"".
And in 2016, state-run paper Minju Joson warned that North Korea would ""constantly strengthen our self-defensive nuclear deterrent"" in response. Within weeks, Pyongyang tested a nuclear warhead.
This year, Sunday's Rodong Sinmun said the situation on the Korean peninsula was a ""touch-and-go crisis that has never been experienced before"".
Earlier this year during Foal Eagle/Key Resolve, it warned it would ""mercilessly foil the nuclear war racket of the aggressors with its treasured nuclear sword of justice"".
But while it has frequently threatened serious retaliation, North Korea usually ends up conducting shows of force, such as firing missiles or moving troops.
Last week, in what was seen as a de-escalation, leader Kim Jong-un said he would watch ""a little more"" before launching missiles in the direction of Guam.
Depending on the political climate, the drills have at times exacerbated tensions between the two sides.
The UFG drill in 2015 took place amid high tensions, which resulted in North and South Korea exchanging artillery fire across the border.
Military officials took the unusual step of halting the UFG while emergency talks were held between the North and South. The drill resumed several days later.
The US and South Korea say that the exercises are purely for defence purposes, and based out of a mutual defence agreement they signed in 1953.
They also say the exercises are necessary to strengthen their readiness in case of an external attack.","North Korea has condemned US-South Korean military exercises as ""pouring gasoline on fire"" and threatened to send missiles towards the US Pacific island of Guam.

""I would take my electorate's view into account, but I would also take into account how the plebiscite played out across Australia because, for example, a referendum gets up if it is a majority of states, majority of people in the majority of states,"" she said.
Meanwhile the video of Mr Shorten telling church leaders in 2013 that he was ""completely relaxed"" about a plebiscite on same-sex marriage has undermined his attack on the government.
Mr Shorten has claimed that the plebiscite would unleash a campaign of homophobia and hate, which could be avoided through a parliamentary vote on gay marriage.
In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corp., he played down his previous comments.
""Community attitudes have moved on in Australia,"" he said.
""When you look at the experience in Ireland, over a year ago, some of arguments which emerged were really ugly and repugnant.""

Before the tour party departed for New Zealand, I thought the All Blacks would win comfortably.
But then I considered South Africa and Australia's decline since the last Rugby World Cup, that England and Ireland have both risen in the rankings, that Scotland beat the Wallabies in Sydney last week, and thought the balance of power was shifting from southern to northern hemisphere rugby.
I looked at the considerable strength and quality of the squad at Warren Gatland's disposal.
Then I added in some weather forecasts that suggested there might be favourable conditions for the Lions forwards at Eden Park.
And maybe I got carried away.
In the opening three minutes, you saw Jonathan Davies go through, offload to Conor Murray and the Lions come up to within a metre.
From there, the All Blacks score.
But the Lions didn't.
Instead Elliot Daly was bundled into touch by a superb bit of defence from Israel Dagg and that set the tone for the game.
New Zealand's players have an individual skill set far above any of their rival teams.
Take second row Brodie Retallick, who is 6ft 8 and 19 and a half stone.
He can push in the scrum and jump in the line-out in his sleep.
When he wakes up though, he plays with the distribution and space awareness of a centre.
From one to 15, they all have the X-factor. But as well as the ability to execute remarkable handling skills, they also have an understanding of how best to deploy them.
Wing Rieko Ioane's first try was a case in point.
The All Blacks had the penalty advantage after a great scrum, but Kieran Read was not only able to scoop an extraordinary off-load off the floor to scrum-half Aaron Smith, but also to realise that, with the Lions pack wheeled, he was opening up the tourists' weak side.
Three passes later Ioane was in.
They were the eye-catching moments.
In general play though, their superiority sprung from a simple aspect of the game that is taught all the way from mini-rugby as a child.
They were coming onto the ball at pace. Or if not, they passed to someone who could.
It meant that they made yards to gain territory, it gave them the upper hand in the breakdown to secure possession and opened up the options of off-loads from which they create try-scoring chances.
The hosts won the collisions.
It was especially important given New Zealand attacked with less width than normal to try and avoid being trapped by a Lions rush that comes up quicker on the outside.
After the match, Gatland called for his men to be more physical, while counterpart Steve Hansen mocked the Lions' presumptions of front-five dominance.
Both coaches knew that basic truth.
The beautiful aspect of rugby is that through cohesion, organisation and commitment you can negate a team of more talented individuals and win through the collective.
The Lions will have come off the pitch at Eden Park thinking about what might have been because they had the opportunities to make the result very different.
They created plenty of chances from long range, one was finished by Sean O'Brien for a spectacular try after Liam Williams' deft sidestep inside his own 22m.
If you are viewing this page on the BBC News app please click here to vote.
But others were left unexploited.
Daly came close early on and could have put Liam Williams in after collecting Owen Farrell's kick on the half hour.
Jonathan Davies' break should have delivered at least five points at the start of the second half before Anthony Watson's weaving run had the All Blacks stretched, but ultimately unbreached.
Rhys Webb's try in the last play of the game may have been meaningless in terms of this weekend, but it was an important psychological blow. Whether it is the first minute or the last, the All Blacks hate conceding.
If the Lions finished off what they created, they could have won this game and that is their glimmer of hope.
The All Blacks always seem to come on strong in the final 20 minutes. The Lions need to be leading rather than chasing as the second Test heads into that decisive period.
I would go for younger, more athletic, options from the start.
Starting Maro Itoje ahead of Alun Wyn Jones in the second row would be the most obvious way to increase the dynamism of the side.
The 22-year-old England lock is an 80-minute animal and made an impact after coming off the bench with a fine line-out steal and several good cover tackles.
Webb's try was a fine piece of opportunism and fellow scrum-half Conor Murray had a couple of wayward kicks, but I would ignore calls for the Welshman to come in from the start.
Webb is a finisher, revelling in the open spaces and tired defences late on, but is too much of an individual to start.
However, I would have a long think about possibly replacing Owen Farrell, who lacked his usual influence, with Johnny Sexton at 10.
Farrell didn't play badly, but his positive contribution was not that obvious either. He missed a kick that by his own high standards was eminently makeable.
Perhaps bringing CJ Stander in ahead of Sam Warburton on the bench would bring more physicality and ball-carry ballast. Maybe Iain Henderson could come in to the 23 as a replacement.
There are not too many changes to make. Ultimately, whoever you put out, you are up against the All Blacks, who are just a phenomenal team.","The Lions lost the first Test to the All Blacks in New Zealand.

222,"Exactly 150 years on, plans are well under way for it to become the centrepiece of a new museum building.
The 70ft (21m) finback whale was discovered at Pevensey Bay on 13 November 1865.
Photographs show people posing beside its corpse.
Updates on this story and more from Cambridgeshire
Tracy Biram, of Cambridge University's Museum of Zoology, said it was ""a massive deal at the time"" - for most people it would have been the first time they had seen a whale.
It was also a huge specimen - the finback is the second largest species after the blue whale.
The skeleton was sold to Cambridge University for £80 the following year (nearly £9,000 at today's prices), but it was many years before it was next seen in public.
Ms Biram said: ""It took a very small team 30 years of engineering and lab work to clean it, conserve it and create the structure to mount it.""
When it was finally put in place in 1896, the Museum of Zoology was open to the public by appointment only, as it was a teaching resource for students and academics.
Since 1996, it has been hung outside the 1960s museum which replaced the Victorian structure.
Ms Biram said: ""It's seen as odd and misguided to put it outside in the elements today, but it hadn't been damaged, it was just very dirty, and we discovered a pigeon skeleton hidden inside when we dismantled it as part of the museum's redevelopment.""
The mammals are still a rare enough sight to attract attention, even in the age of wildlife documentaries and whale-watching tours, and even when dead.
""It's not a morbid fascination,"" said Ben Garrod, an Anglia Ruskin University evolutionary biologist.
""It's the closest thing many of us have to a wild experience and, rightly or wrongly, when they strand that's our rare opportunity to see them.""
The fascination with beached whales appears to have been with us for centuries.
In early 17th Century Netherlands, crowds flocked to see sperm whales washed ashore by storms along the North Sea coast, according to the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.
A stranded whale was discovered underneath layers of paint during the conservation of one of its 17th Century Dutch paintings last year.
It was one of many images of whales and other ""aquatic wonders"" printed at the time, and the museum believes the whale was painted over in the 18th or 19th Century to suit changing tastes or to make it more marketable.
However, for people of the 17th Century the mammals were seen as sea monsters or signs of impending disaster.
Mr Garrod said: ""We now know they're not killers, but then they were the unknown monsters, or the biblical Leviathan.
""And in the 19th Century, the novel Moby Dick shaped generations of people's views of whales, the way the film Jaws shaped our idea of Great Whites.""
About 5% of the 600 cetaceans found stranded around the UK coast every year are whales, according to Rob Deaville.
He is the project manager of the Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme, which investigates whale, dolphin and porpoise strandings on behalf of Defra.
They are far more likely to be the smaller whale species such as the minke than the finback, although several of the latter have been discovered this year.
Scientists still have so much more to find out about whales.
Mr Deaville said research carried out by the Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme, including post-mortems to uncover cause of deaths, ""allows us to learn more about marine species that are otherwise very difficult to study"".
""Seventy percent of the world is covered in water and we don't know what's down there,"" said Mr Garrod.
""Just a week ago we got the first-ever footage of a brand new species of whale, the Omura's whale.""
The Pevensey Bay skeleton was dismantled last year, because the Museum of Zoology closed for a substantial £3.67m rebuild.
Museum staff have raised nearly half the £150,000 they need to conserve it and their other large skeletons.
It should be back on display, in pride of place in its own glass hall, early in 2017.","150 years after its discovery, the finback whale skeleton, found at Pevensey Bay in 1865, is set to become the centerpiece of a new museum building.

The main UK parties have said they were committed to devolving new powers, expected to include welfare and tax.
Ms Sturgeon said the parties would face a backlash if they were not delivered.
She told the Sunday Times: ""I've said it directly to Lord Smith - we go into this in good faith. We won't get everything we want from it.
""It is not going to deliver independence but it has to go a very long way to deliver what people out there think was promised to them. It has to be a comprehensive package.

Last weekend, Spain was given 100bn euros ($125bn; Â£80bn) in emergency loans to help its struggling banks.
The IMF said Spain needed to raise revenue from taxes, and look at further spending cuts. However, it added that Madrid should not look to cut its deficit too quickly given ""an unprecedented double-dip recession with unemployment already high"".
Spain has the highest unemployment rate in the eurozone, with almost one in four workers out of a job.
Earlier this year, the government announced 27bn euros of cuts from its budget as part of one of the toughest austerity drives in the country's history.
Changes included freezing unemployment benefits and public sector workers' salaries, slashing departmental budgets and increasing tax on large companies.
But the spending cuts and tax rises have undermined the economic recovery in Spain. The country is back in recession and its banks are severely under-capitalised given the collapse in the Spanish property market.

Free from the pressures and pretensions of life in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, where the struggles of the middle class are over who drives the latest model of which car, and who lives in the poshest neighbourhood.
In Nairobi, many people, especially the young, are obsessed with the nauseating celebrity culture, whose lifestyle glitters so much it can blind you.
Landing from the heights of Nairobi's razzle-dazzle, Freetown humbles you.
First, if your heart was in your mouth as the aeroplane shook and trembled in the rainy season, then your heart will be in your hand on the ground as you take the ferry from Lungi International Airport, to Freetown.
You can tell who is a foreigner by the strained look in their faces, as the small ferry dances and slices across the waves.
I have been waiting to get to Sierra Leone for the last 20 years. I reported on the country since the early 1990s, from the safety of London.
I played my favourite Sierra Leonean music on the BBC Network Africa breakfast show, but never made it to Freetown. So when an opportunity arose, to come and train young journalists at the Africa Young Voices TV station, I seized it with both hands and feet!
Alighting from the ferry at Freetown, you can immediately tell the state of unemployment in the country, by the vast number of baggage handlers employed by the ferry companies.
The drive through the streets immediately brings home the effects of more than a decade of civil war, and the tragedy that was Ebola.
The city is overcrowded, with lots of informal settlements, and the infrastructure is bursting at the seams.
There is a serious problem of waste management. The current government, which has put a lot of effort into infrastructure projects and stabilising the economy, has its work cut out.
The people of Freetown are desperate to be free from the threats of disease.
Joseph Warungu:
""As soon as we began to talk politics, my spirit was brought crashing down""
But it is in my interactions with people that lift my spirits. They do not call it ""Sweet Salone"" for no reason.
The people here are warm, friendly and generous. And whether it is as a result of trying to forget the pain of the past or not, it is clear they love to have a good time.
Everywhere you go, you will find clubs and social places where people gather to set themselves free from the struggles of the week through great music, dance, food and laughter.
So I have had more than my fair share of Jollof rice and cassava leaves. For an east African, the pepper in the food is on the side of plenty-oh, and so a glass of water is always at hand - much to the amusement of my hosts.
I run a national mentorship programme for young journalists in Kenya in the form of a TV programme called Top Story. So I became completely at home when I eventually began to train the young Sierra Leonean journalists and broadcasters.
Their hunger for knowledge and skills and enthusiasm sent me on a high. But as soon as we began to talk politics, my spirit was brought crashing down.
Like my own country and many others in Africa, corruption is a big threat to the people.
Like Kenya, here too society is divided into the two rival sides that will be seeking office in the next election. And the issues are exactly the same - a high cost of living, unemployment and demands for better governance.
After my first week here, I was ready to explore some of the key towns whose names have been on my lips as a broadcast journalist in the last 20 years - Bo, Makeni, Kabala, Kenema and Koiduâ€¦
Then I will perhaps be ready to re-engage with the rat-race of life and the paralysing traffic of Nairobi.

237,"Copies of the draft legal advice given by former attorney general Lord Goldsmith was previously kept secret despite calls for it to be published.
The Cabinet Office said it had decided to de-classify now because of the ""very exceptional"" nature of the inquiry.
There has been long running controversy over whether the war was lawful.
In his evidence to the inquiry in January, Lord Goldsmith acknowledged he had changed his mind on whether a second UN resolution was needed ahead of military action in March 2003.
He had thought one was needed but had ultimately concluded, shortly before the war began, that military action was authorised by existing UN agreements dating back to 1991.
By Peter BilesBBC world affairs correspondent at the Iraq inquiry
The irritation over the government's reluctance to declassify key documents relating to the Iraq war erupted in January this year when Lord Goldsmith was giving evidence to the Iraq inquiry.
The chairman, Sir John Chilcot, shared Lord Goldsmith's frustration that the former attorney general's draft legal advice could not be made public at the time. The documents in question had, of course, been seen by the inquiry's committee, but remained classified.
Five months on, the government has made an exception by releasing Lord Goldsmith's papers. These are not the first documents to be declassified by the Cabinet Office for the Iraq inquiry, but perhaps the most significant.
The 27 pages, each one with the words ""secret"" or ""confidential"" struck out, were distributed without ceremony.
The documents contain much of what was already known about Lord Goldsmith's legal advice on military action in Iraq, but his views are now on the public record to back up his earlier testimony.
He denied that this came as a result of political pressure from No 10 or anyone else.
The government published the details of Lord Goldsmith's final legal advice to the Cabinet - issued on 7 March - in 2005.
However, campaigners have long called for the release of details of the attorney general's initial legal advice to the prime minister, provided on February 12, 2003.
In this published correspondence, he told Mr Blair that should military action be taken without further approval by the UN Security Council, he expected ""the government to be accused of acting unlawfully"".
However, he said that following a visit to Washington in early 2003, he was ""prepared to accept that a reasonable case"" could be made that military action was authorised by existing resolutions, including resolution 1441 in November 2002.
He cited the fact British forces had undertaken military action in Iraq in 1998, and Kosovo in 1999, and in both cases his predecessors as attorney general had given the go ahead on the basis that doing so was ""no more than reasonably arguable"".
But the documents also give further insight into Lord Goldsmith change of mind on the issue.
In a letter to the prime minister on 30 January, 2003, Lord Goldsmith said he ""remained of the view that the correct legal interpretation of resolution 1441 is that it does not authorise the use of military force without a further determination by the Security Council"".
Several government lawyers have told the Iraq inquiry that they believed the invasion was unlawful without explicit UN authorisation.
Elizabeth Wilmshurst, a senior Foreign Office lawyer who resigned in protest at the war, told the inquiry earlier this year that she believed the way the government considered the legal arguments for war was ""lamentable"".
In a letter explaining his decision to de-classify the documents, head of the civil service Sir Gus O'Donnell said it was a ""long-standing convention"" that legal advice to ministers was not published so as not to compromise their ability to provide ""full, frank and candid advice"".
But he said arguments over the legality of the war in Iraq had a ""unique status"".
""The government's actions with respect to the decision to use military force in Iraq, have in party, contributed to a widely-held view that the public and Parliament are entitled to some explanation for the legal basis for the decision,"" he said.
He added: ""The Iraq inquiry was established with the purpose of learning lessons from how decisions were made and which actions were taken in the run-up to conflict, during the conflict and its aftermath.
Lord Goldsmith draft advice: February 12, 2003
""The question of the legal base for military action and how the advice that led to the government's view on this developed is consequently a central part of the inquiry's work....
""I have considered the matter carefully and believe that, given the very exceptional nature, of the Iraq inquiry, this particular material can be declassified without prejudice... to the convention in relation to the law officers' advice.""
The Iraq inquiry panel had copies of the declassified documents before Lord Goldsmith appeared before them.
The BBC's World Affairs Correspondent Peter Biles said the documents ""put on record"" how Lord Goldsmith came to his final decision on the legality of the war but did not appear to shed new light on why he reached the decision.
Our correspondent said the former attorney general had already made it clear that his view on the issue had ""evolved"" and that he decided a further UN resolution, while desirable, was not necessary.

240,"David McFarlane, 35, Jack Craig, 21, and Robert Prowse, 20, were onboard the Purbeck Isle when it went missing.
The Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) report said it was ""entirely possible"" they could have survived if the raft had inflated.
The report also said the boat lacked distress signal devices, so the coastguard was not alerted for hours.
The boat was not found until the day after it sank, south of Portland Bill at a depth of 164ft (50m).
The MAIB report has strongly advised fishing vessel owners to ensure life rafts are stowed and secured properly.
The fishermen had set off from Weymouth on the wooden potting vessel when it foundered on 17 May last year.
The boat sank so quickly they were unable to broadcast a mayday call, collect their lifejackets or manually launch the vessel's four-man life raft before they went overboard, the report said.
A release unit used to secure the life raft in its cradle activated as the vessel sank.
But the raft failed to float free and inflate because it had not been properly stowed and sank to the seabed.
""Because the life raft canister did not fit snugly into its cradle, the skipper had applied additional lashings to prevent it from falling off the wheelhouse roof in heavy seas,"" the report said.
""These additional lashings had been intertwined with the life raft's main lashing rope and they prevented the raft from floating free.""
The life raft was stowed upside down which would have allowed water to build up, the report said.
Meanwhile, the coastguard was not alerted to the Purbeck Isle's plight for seven hours as it was not fitted with an emergency position-indicating radio beacon or similar distress signalling device.
The body of Mr McFarlane, from Weymouth, was found entangled in ropes attached to Purbeck Isle's two lifebuoys the day after the sinking. The wreck of the vessel was found later that day.
The search for the two missing fishermen was called off on 19 May.
The body of Mr Craig, from Portland, was recovered from the seabed in Lyme Bay by a trawler on 9 August. The body of Mr Prowse, from Weymouth, has not been found.

This watery period dates to between 9,000 and 17,000 years ago.

""The thick salt crusts kept underneath a precious record of a period when these flatlands hosted lakes and wetlands.""
This watery area would have covered about 600 sq km of the desert.
The period they date to - from 9,000-17,000 years ago - was a time when hunter-gatherers from the north would have started to colonise South America.
Archaeologists had thought that these ancient people avoided the desert as they migrated to other regions - but the presence of water means it could have supported people.
""Instead of rapidly moving through the few wet streams that exist nowadays from the coast to the Andes, now with this evidence, there was a place where they could settle down and colonise more easily the entire region.""
He said that some evidence of human settlements in these once-lake-covered areas had recently been found, and these sites were now being carefully excavated.
However, despite the finding that the Atacama once had lakes and wetlands, scientists do not think that this was caused by rain directly falling on the region.
It is likely ultra-low precipitation conditions have existed here for about 2.5 million years. So for there to have been major wet features, the water must have been imported.
The answer may be the so-called Central Andean Pluvial Events, which saw increased rainfall above the Andes mountains and it was this water that drained into the Atacama Desert.

243,"Mr Blunkett backed an opt-in system of censorship, saying the Lib Dems had been wrong to reject it at their party conference last week.
Civilised society risked being undermined by ""the most bestial activities"", he warned.
He was speaking at a Demos fringe meeting at the Labour conference.
Lib Dem members voted last week to reject a plan for internet providers to block online pornography unless web users ""opt in"".
The vote put them at odds with their Conservative coalition partners who want UK service providers to impose ""default"" filters to block pornography. Labour has backed the Conservative position and urged the prime minister to go further and boost the resources of internet pornography watchdogs.
Mr Blunkett told the Demos fringe meeting: ""The Lib Dems in Glasgow debated this and decided they were against automatic protection unless people chose to over-ride it, in terms of pornography on the internet and the protection of children. I think they were wrong.
Lib Dems reject porn filters plan
""I think we have a job in this country, in a civilised, free, open democracy, to protect ourselves from the most bestial activities and from dangers that would undermine a civilised nation.""
Drawing a parallel with Germany before the rise of the Nazis, he suggested a loose moral climate had fed the paranoia and fear that had allowed Adolf Hitler to flourish.
""In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Berlin came as near as dammit to Sodom and Gomorrah. There was a disintegration of what you might call any kind of social order.
""People fed on that - they fed people's fears of it. They encouraged their paranoia. They developed hate about people who had differences, who were minorities.
""There always has had to be some balance, in terms of the freedom of what we want to do, for ourselves and the mutual respect and the duty we owe to each other in a collective society. I think getting it right is the strength of a democracy.""
Helen Goodman, Labour's shadow minister for media reform, reached further back into history to illustrate her point, comparing the internet to a lawless 13th Century forest.
""It would be quite wrong if we were to preserve a special place within the law, where the net could be outside the law. The net today should not be like the forest in the 13th Century.
""Robin Hood and the outlaws - they were called that because they were outside the law - that was not a sustainable position in the 13th Century and it's not a sustainable position now.""
She said the same principles of law that apply in the real world should also apply online.
And she made the case for new laws making it easier for internet users to be traced through their IP address, something the government is investigating.
Nick Pickles, director of the Big Brother Watch pressure group, opted for another historical analogy, saying politicians exaggerated the extent to which the internet was a lawless ""Wild West"".
The real problem, he argued, was a lack of transparency and ""privatised surveillance"", with internet giants being paid to store data on citizens on behalf of the state.
Britain's outdated security laws were cloaked in secrecy and not publicly accountable - and had little or no judicial oversight, he added.
And he urged Labour to challenge ""an outdated culture of surveillance and a legal framework that is struggling to keep up"".
Mr Blunkett, who was home secretary between 2002 and 2005, was in expansive mood at the Demos fringe, in front of an audience who felt the last Labour government had not done enough to protect civil liberties (there was a show of hands).
He said he was proud of much of what he had achieved as home secretary, such as the scrapping of the ""double jeopardy"" rule, allowing retrials of people cleared of serious crimes when new evidence comes to light, which had led to the trial of the Stephen Lawrence suspects.
But he admitted to early ""hiccups"" with the controversial Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, which was initially abused by local authorities to spy on householders.
When asked why things had gone wrong, he said: ""Because we are human and we are frail and when we pass something we can not guarantee that other people won't misuse it.""
He also confessed to using overblown language in response to the terror threat.
""There were times when my rhetoric probably exceeded what was necessary.
""My excuse for this is that actually at a time of considerable threat, when people are fearful, the only way of securing their confidence and reducing their fear is to take sufficient, substantial but necessary action to make sure that they feel that someone is in charge and that they know what they doing and that they deal with those new international threats.""
He added: ""The idea that somehow the Labour government got it drastically wrong - I would say this wouldn't I? - is a nonsense.""","Mr Blunkett, a former home secretary, has backed an opt-in system of internet censorship, saying the Lib Dems were wrong to reject it at their party conference.

244,"The House of Commons is debating the legislation that would trigger Article 50.
The SNP - which has tabled a motion that would delay the bill - and Liberal Democrats are opposed, but Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has ordered his MPs to vote with the government.
However some Labour MPs are expected to defy Mr Corbyn.
The government remains determined to trigger negotiations on the UK's withdrawal from the European Union by the end of March.
But the SNP's amendment to the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill criticises the government for failing to  consult effectively with the devolved administrations on the plans for Brexit.
It also says the government has yet to publish a White Paper detailing its policy proposals, has refused to give a guarantee on the position of EU nationals in the UK, and has provided no assurance that a future parliamentary vote will be anything other than irrelevant.
Speaking as he outlined the amendment, SNP MP Stephen Gethins said triggering Article 50 would have a major economic impact on Scotland.
He argued that the only detailed plans for Brexit had been published by the Scottish and Welsh governments.
And he said Scotland had voted to Remain and was now being taken out of the EU by a Conservative Party that just posted its worst general election result since 1865 in Scotland.
Mr Gethins said: ""Passing this bill and turning your back on our amendment would turn its back on the progress made and disrespect the devolution settlement.
""I'd urge members to vote for our amendment, otherwise this is a backward and damaging step and it is an act of constitutional and economic sabotage.""
Mr Gethins found an unlikely ally in former Tory Chancellor Ken Clarke, who said he would be ""voting with his conscience"" and backing the SNP amendment.
Mr Clarke described visions of a post-Brexit future as a ""wonderland"" fantasy.
He also mocked the government's hopes for free trade after leaving the single market, and claimed that ""no sensible country has referendums"".
The government had resisted having a vote in the Commons, but was forced to seek parliament's approval for its plans by a Supreme Court ruling last week.
Its Brexit secretary, David Davis, told the debate that MPs would not be able to vote to block Brexit, telling them the ""point of no return"" had already passed.
He added: ""This is not a bill about whether the UK should leave the EU or indeed how it should do it.
""It is simply about parliament empowering the government to implement a decision already made, a point of no return already passed.
""We asked the people of the UK if they wanted to leave the EU. They decided they did. So at the core of this Bill lies a very simple question. Do we trust the people or not?
""We will respect the will of the people and implement their will by 31 March.""
The debate is due to last two days, with the government expected to win the final vote - although the size of the rebellion by Labour MPs against their instructions to vote with the government is not yet clear.
Labour's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, said two thirds of Labour MPs represented constituencies that voted to leave the EU, and one third where people voted to stay in.
""This is obviously a difficult decision,"" he said.
""I wish the result had gone the other way. I campaigned passionately for that. But as democrats our party has to accept that result and it follows that the prime minister should not be blocked from starting the Article 50 negotiations.""","The House of Commons is currently debating the legislation that would trigger Article 50, which would initiate the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.

Nyomi Fee and her partner Rachel Fee deny murdering Liam on 22 March 2014 and blame his death on another child.
Liam Fee was found dead in a house near Glenrothes, Fife.
The pair are also charged with a catalogue of allegations that they neglected Liam and abused two other children, one of whom they blame for killing Liam, while in their care over a two-year period.
The women, who are both originally from Ryton, Tyne and Wear, deny all the charges against them.
Nyomi Fee also told police she had been playing ""High Fives"" with him on the day he died, the court heard.
The 29-year-old told Constable Dorothy Millar that the two-year-old ""liked to high five"" - lifting up his arm and smacking palms with her.
In an interview statement she gave a few days after Liam was found dead in the Fife flat Nyomi Fee shared with Liam's mum Rachel, she added: ""He would mimic with his hands and he would copy me.""
However, a jury previously heard medical evidence that the tragic toddler had a broken arm and a broken thigh which would have caused him pain if he moved.
In Nyomi Fee's statement, which she signed on every page after it was read back to her, she said she had played with Liam in the afternoon while Rachel Fee was out looking after her horse.
Rachel Fee returned home at about 18:15 and they poured themselves glasses of vodka and fizzy orange and put on some music.
She said: ""Liam was nodding off in his buggy so we decided to put him in his room. I think it was around 6.30pm - Rachel hadn't been back that long.
""Rachel and I went to the living room and put on a Clubland CD to listen to some music.
""It wasn't loud enough to annoy the neighbours but we couldn't hear the kids playing in their room as the door was closed.""
Nyomi said she shut Liam in his bedroom asleep in his buggy with the door shut.
When she went back to check on him at what ""must have been"" 7.40pm, she found the buggy had been moved forward to a new position.
Liam was lying lifeless in it with his face partly covered with a blanket.
""He was so white,"" she told police, ""so I pulled the blanket off him.
""I picked up his hands and they were floppy. I just knew he was dead because he was so white.
""I screamed for Rachel: 'Rachel, Rachel!' and she came straight through. She started screaming: 'Call an ambulance'.  I dialled 999 then I got Liam.""
Earlier the jury heard evidence from wound nurse Pauline Emslie, 47, that the Fees brought a seven year-old boy they blame for Liam's death to her for examination.
She said she found a pressure ulcer on his toe and skin grafts ""very badly infected"" with redness spreading up the foot.
She said: ""Rachel was very surprised and asked how this could have happened. I explained to her that infections do sometimes happen in children.
""I did ask when she thought the infection had started. She said it must have just happened.
""I think it would have been very difficult not to notice that the feet were like that. They'd have been very painful and it looked like the infection was well established.""
She went on: ""I contacted the health visitor and also the child protection adviser at the Sick Children's Hospital.
""I had concerns because after the initial injury there seemed to be a delay in seeking medical advice because the wounds were very deep, and this time it was an infection that had not been noticed.""

Police in Belgium are investigating and a full toxicology report is expected next week.
The husband of Jagger's co-owner said: ""I can only hope it wasn't an act of jealousy by another competitor, but just a lunatic.""
Jagger, who came second in his class at Birmingham's NEC on Thursday, is owned by Belgian Aleksandra Lauwers and Leicester-based breeder Dee Milligan-Bott.
Mrs Lauwers's husband Willem said the couple was ""devastated"" by the death.
""My wife has to go and give a statement to the police tomorrow and we'll see what happens,"" he said.

He said CCTV from the NEC was being analysed, but the number of dogs and members of public at the event could make it very difficult.

""We compete week-in, week-out against each other and we have one thing in common, we all love dogs,"" she said.

PC Phillips was killed three weeks after Williams' subsequent release from a Young Offenders' Institution.
Williams was cleared of murder but has been found guilty of manslaughter.
Neighbours described Williams as a ""troubled boy"".
The BBC has learned authorities had tried to engage with the Williams family to try to prevent the 19-year-old's offending, but the attempt failed.
Two days after the non-fatal crash in May 2015, Williams appeared in court charged with aggravated vehicle taking and the court dealt with previous offences relating to a motorbike that he drove up Rake Lane with no insurance or licence in August 2014.
Court records from the time describe Williams as having ""an appalling record"" when he got into a stolen car with his friend and was ""on bail for a very similar offence"" before the fatal crash involving PC Phillips.
On 2 June 2015, the judge - Mr Recorder Edge - said: ""I see that you have members of your family and your girlfriend who are in court.
""No doubt you have been a profound disappointment to them all for a long time.""
He added: ""I hope this has been the wakeup call that has been described. You could have killed yourself, you could have killed your mate and you could have killed those other people.""
PC Phillips, 34, was struck in Birkenhead in October 2015 as he deployed a stinger device to stop the stolen Mitsubishi 4x4 driven by Williams. He sustained injuries that were ""not survivable"".
Williams said he had used cannabis since the age of six and was heavily under the influence of the class B drug when he crashed into the officer.
One person living near the Williams home in Seacombe, Wirral said he was a ""a troubled boy.""
""He was out of control. I'm not surprised something bad happened. I always thought he'd move on from petty crime,"" said the neighbour, who did not want to be identified.
For the earlier New Brighton crash, Williams was sentenced to 32 weeks in a Young Offenders' Institution at Liverpool Crown Court.
After his release, the neighbour asked where he had been. ""He smirked and said 'inside',"" they told the BBC. ""He really wasn't bothered at all.""
Other neighbours recall that police were ""always"" being called to the house.
One of the agencies working with the Williams family was Catch 22, an organisation known for intensive interventions with the hardest-to-reach families.

251,"Both the SDLP and Sinn Fein have suggested creating an all Ireland national forum to consider the implications of Brexit.
On Saturday, Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Mary Lou McDonald said the Irish government had confirmed such a forum would be set up.
Maybe it would lead to something, but unionists would probably shy away and, at first glance, it looks like a talking shop.
Stormont and Dublin ministers are discussing Brexit in their North South Council and an early meeting of the East West British Irish Council has been promised. Neither of these spin-offs from the Good Friday Agreement have proved especially dynamic.
But if the UK does sever its EU links then their role could become much more important.
As Professor Brendan O'Leary recently pointed out in a lecture at Queen's University, the BIC already straddles islands like Jersey Guernsey and the Isle of Man which are not EU members.
The Remain camp will no doubt continue to press for Northern Ireland to retain its EU status.
However the opposition Nicola Sturgeon ran into in Brussels shows this is likely to prove an uphill struggle, assuming the next UK prime minister doesn't perform a U turn.
So how might what Irish Foreign Minister Charlie Flanagan described as the ""unique circumstances"" of the island of Ireland be recognised?
Both the Irish and British governments have already made it clear they want to preserve the free movement of goods and people - this will require some first class diplomacy if it is to amount to an Irish ""opt-out"" from barriers erected elsewhere.
On the ground, perhaps the remainers could turn to the old Europhile John Hume's dictum that ""it's people that have rights not territory""?
Alongside all the various talking shops, might Dublin consider, for example,  setting up an agency to liaise with Irish passport holders resident outside its borders?
That could ensure these EU citizens still have access to European programmes like the Erasmus educational exchanges or the Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme.
Whilst the DUP would no doubt oppose any initiative they believe might be aimed at watering down Northern Ireland's constitutional status within the UK, there seems agreement around the executive table about ensuring Northern Ireland gets a ""good deal"".
Stormont's leavers and remainers can at least make common cause by lobbying a future prime minister for extra cash funds to replace any European peace or cross border funding which local groups stand to lose.
The challenge in the months ahead will be to ensure the big picture divide between the parties over both the future of the EU and the UK doesn't paralyse the task of trying to alleviate the practical impact of Brexit on ordinary citizens.","The SDLP and Sinn Fein have proposed creating an all-Ireland national forum to consider the implications of Brexit.

252,"Jim Robertson, from Glasgow, who lost his wife to sepsis last year, is petitioning the Scottish Parliament to back a national awareness campaign.
Health boards are actively working on reducing sepsis, but some are wary of such an initiative.
One said it could lead to ""unnecessary"" attendance at GP surgeries.
Sepsis kills about 44,000 people every year in the UK - more than breast, bowel and prostate cancer combined.
It is caused when the body's immune system overreacts to infection.
Mr Robertson's wife Liz died in hospital from sepsis in February last year at the age of 61.
He said: ""It still haunts me. In the last week, I would say, of Liz's life she was delirious, she was nauseous, she was constantly vomiting, she didn't know where she lived.""
Sepsis is triggered by infections, but is actually a problem with our own immune system going into overdrive.
It starts with an infection that can come from anywhere - even a contaminated cut or insect bite.
Normally, your immune system kicks in to fight the infection and stop it spreading.
But if the infection manages to spread quickly round the body, then the immune system will launch a massive immune response to fight it.
This can also be a problem as the immune response can have catastrophic effects on the body, leading to septic shock, organ failure and even death.
Mr Robertson believes she could still be alive if she had been diagnosed sooner.
He said the first time he heard the word sepsis was after his wife's post mortem.
""I didn't really know anything about it at all, apart from that it was blood poisoning and I discovered there was a very, very low awareness of sepsis and the size of sepsis in Scotland - in fact in the whole of the UK.""
Mr Robertson said he was ""astonished"" at some of the responses from NHS boards to his petition lodged with the Scottish Parliament.
He added: ""Some, in fact, have come back with a response that if we make people aware of the early signs of sepsis, then it might cause a greater workload for our GPs, so they are not that keen, which I find very surprising and disappointing.""
In its written submission, NHS Dumfries and Galloway said a public campaign specifically about sepsis ""may actually cause alarm and increase unnecessary attendance at GP practices or A&E departments"".
NHS Forth Valley's submission read: ""It is necessary to consider the unintended consequences of inappropriately increasing public awareness.""
Other boards including Tayside, Grampian and Greater Glasgow and Clyde all said they would welcome a national public awareness campaign - something experts believe would save lives.
Prof Kevin Rooney, a consultant in intensive care medicine at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, said: ""I would definitely support an awareness campaign with the public.
""We have been working with health care professionals to date, but in the end we need you to help us.
""For every hour's delay in antibiotics, your mortality from sepsis increases by almost 8%, so if we can get people in the community to the hospitals quicker, that will surely make a difference.""
The Scottish government said it would support any campaign to raise awareness of sepsis.
A spokesman added: ""Our Scottish Patient Safety Programme is a unique national programme recognised as setting the benchmark for systemic approaches to health care improvement, including the treatment of sepsis.
""We have a long-standing commitment to raising awareness of sepsis, involving working closely with NHS Scotland and the Fiona Elizabeth Agnew Trust, supporting the Sock it to Sepsis campaign and promoting and participating in World Sepsis Day.
""We recognise that focusing on early identification of sepsis is critical - and treatment within one hour of recognition has led to mortality rates among those identified at this stage falling by 21% since 2012.""","Jim Robertson, from Glasgow, who lost his wife to sepsis, is petitioning the Scottish Parliament to back a national awareness campaign.

258,"In an election with more than 100 million ballots cast, that's all it took to make George W Bush president in 2000.
So while the US presidential election is often described as an exercise in appealing to as many voters as possible, candidates will never neglect a niche audience.
Here are five groups - both large and small - that could tip the scales in 2016.
Polling has shown that these are the core voters for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. His positions on trade and immigration have resonated with working-class voters. But the question is - Are there enough of them, especially in battleground states, to carry him to victory?
Don Levy, who conducts polls in New York state, says Mr Trump would have to win these voters at a ""tremendously high margin"".  Mr Trump's supporters are optimistic that can happen and often pose these two complementary theories:
Mr Levy, the director of the Siena College Research Institute, says he isn't buying either scenario. In his polling, he says that voters have not been reluctant to voice their support for Mr Trump, often keeping pollsters on the phone for long periods explaining why they support the billionaire businessman. And in a race with such unpopular candidates, he expects lower turnout - not a wave of new voters.
Perhaps, most importantly, Mr Levy notes that to get Mr Trump to the White House, he will not need just those men - he will also need their wives.
""There is a lot of talk about the 'Angry White Man' vote,"" Mr Levy says. ""Trump certainly appeals to that group. But many of those angry white men are married to people. He needs to carry 'Mrs Angry White Man' too.""
Unfortunately for Mr Trump, his favourability numbers among women are dismal, especially among highly-educated women.
Where they count: So-called ""Rust Belt"" states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania
A traditionally Republican constituency, university-educated white women are moving firmly into the Democratic coalition. Focus groups have found that highly-educated women have been put off by some of Mr Trump's provocative statements. A Pew Research study found that voters were particularly repelled by an incident where Mr Trump mocked a disabled journalist and another where he implied that Fox News presenter Megyn Kelly was menstruating because she asked a tough question at a debate.
This has helped turn two battleground states - Virginia and Colorado - into likely wins for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Both states have high levels of educational attainment - 43% of Colorado residents have a university degree, while 44% of Virginia residents are university graduates.
Mr Trump has alienated women pretty effectively, says Virginia pollster Harry Wilson of Roanoke College. ""And once people are turned against you, it's difficult to get them back.""
Where they count: Virginia and Colorado
In mid-July, Mr Trump was enjoying a slim lead in the polls, signalling that the New York billionaire could pull off a narrow win in November with a united Republican coalition. But by August, after a series of inflammatory statements, Mr Trump's popularity had cratered. Frank Luntz, a news analyst for Fox News and CBS who specialises in polling and focus groups, is in search of the voters Mr Trump lost.
He says it is a broad group, but it skews younger and more female. He believes the former supporters were attracted to Mr Trump's message that the ""system is broken"" and an outsider is needed to fix Washington.
""But now they see Trump as mean-spirited, unkind and just hateful,"" Mr Luntz said.
There is time to win them back, but the veteran political analyst is doubtful Mr Trump will use the time wisely. He says the Republican nominee lacks focus to stay on a message of change, which appeals to these disaffected supporters.
""The more fed up you are with the system the more likely you are to vote for Donald Trump, no matter where you are on the political spectrum,"" Mr Luntz said.
Where they count: Florida, Ohio and Nevada
In recent years, Puerto Rico has seen an economic downturn that has sent residents of the US territory to the mainland in search of better opportunities. Many have settled in central Florida, potentially tipping the balance of the deeply divided state. Mike Binder, a political science professor at University of North Florida, says more than half of new voters registered in the state since 2012 are Latino, many of them Puerto Rican.
Long dominated by its Cuban community, Florida's Latinos have typically supported Republican candidates. However in 2016, the rising Puerto Rican population - combined with Mr Trump's immigration policies, which some see as anti-Latino - could change that.
These new voters may not be the largest voting bloc, but in Florida a small edge could deliver a win. Polls show an extremely tight race between Mrs Clinton and Mr Trump. President Obama won the state by only 74,000 votes in 2012.
Where they count: Florida
While some Christian groups have either tolerated or embraced the brash persona of Mr Trump, Mormons - typically dutiful Republicans - have soundly rejected the New York billionaire.
Once a persecuted religious minority, many Mormons were deeply unsettled by Mr Trump's plan to temporarily ban Muslims from travelling to the US. Polls have shown that Utah - which hasn't voted for a Democrat since the 1960s - is suddenly not a sure bet for Republicans in 2016.
Two third-party candidates, Independent Evan McMullin and Libertarian Gary Johnson, are also based in Salt Lake City. Their appeal to Mormons further complicates Mr Trump's efforts to eke out a victory in Utah. Mormons, along with a rising Latino population, could also sway the vote in neighbouring Arizona. Polls there show a tight race, with Mrs Clinton leading in some surveys.

259,"The Help-to-Buy Mortgage Guarantee scheme is likely to have helped more than 100,000 individuals or couples buy a home.
The Council of Mortgage Lenders said it had worked ""exceptionally well"", making mortgages more available when it started in October 2013.
However Shelter has argued that the scheme helped to push up house prices.
Under the programme, borrowers were able to get a mortgage with just a 5% deposit. If those borrowers were unable to make payments, the government promised to compensate the lender.
But around 30 banks or building societies now offer similar high loan-to-value loans, so the Bank of England declared in September that the scheme is no longer necessary.
The Help-to-Buy Equity Loan scheme - which is only available on new-build homes - will remain on offer until 2020, in England alone.
Have you used this scheme? If so, email us at haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.
So far the Mortgage Guarantee scheme has cost the taxpayer a relatively small amount of money.
Up to 30 September, only two home-owners had defaulted on their mortgages, meaning that the Treasury has had to pay out just Â£17,411 to compensate mortgage lenders.
In the long run it has set aside a potential Â£12bn to pay out in compensation.
With interest rates at record lows, default rates have also been minimal.
However when interest rates eventually rise, more borrowers are likely to default on mortgage payments, so the Treasury may have to pay out more.
The guarantee on such mortgages - and thus taxpayers' liability - lasts for seven years after they are taken out.
As a result the Treasury won't know the final cost of the scheme until June 2024.

266,"But many are glowering over Nolan turning a blind eye to the role of Indian soldiers in the battle. The Times of India wrote that their ""significant contribution"" was missing from Nolan's ""otherwise brilliant"" work. Writing for Bloomberg View, columnist Mihir Sharma said the film ""adds to the falsehood that plucky Britons stood alone against Nazi Germany once France fell, when, in fact, hundreds of millions of imperial subjects stood, perforce, with them"".
Few can deny the role of the subjects. Some five million Commonwealth servicemen joined the military services of the British empire during WW2. Almost half of them were from South Asia. Indian soldiers played a key role in major battles like Tobruk, Monte Cassino, Kohima and Imphal. A multinational force of British, Indian and African units recaptured Burma (Myanmar) for the Allies.
What happened with the Indian soldiers in Dunkirk is less clear. Yasmin Khan, historian and author of The Raj at War: A People's History of India's Second World War, says she has often wondered why there is very little factual data on their role in the battle, which many say cost Germany the war.
What is well known, she told me, is that four companies of the Royal Indian Army Service Corps, including a unit of the Bikaner State forces, served in France during the campaign on the Western Front, and some were evacuated from Dunkirk. Among them were three contingents of the Royal Indian Army Service Corps. One contingent was taken prisoner by German forces.
According to one account, India also provided more than 2,500 mules - shipped from Bombay (now Mumbai) to Marseilles - to the war effort as the British animal transport companies had been phased out. An Indian soldier, Jemadar Maula Dad Khan, was feted for showing ""magnificent courage, coolness and decision"" in protecting his men and animals whey they were shelled from the ground and strafed from the air by the enemy.
The Indian soldiers and the mules were eventually ordered towards the coast. Many of the men could not take their animals on the retreat and gave them away to local people in France, according to the same account.
Historian John Broich says the Indian soldiers in Dunkirk were ""particularly cool under fire and well organised during the retreat"".
""They weren't large in number, maybe a few hundred among hundreds of thousands, but their appearance in the film would have provided a good reminder of how utterly central the role of the Indian Army was in the war,"" he told Slate.
""Their service meant the difference between victory and defeat. In fact, while Britain and other allies were licking their wounds after Dunkirk, the Indian Army picked up the slack in North Africa and the Middle East.
To be fair, Nolan has said that he approached the story ""from the point of view of the pure mechanics of survival rather than from the politics of the event"".
""We don't have generals in rooms pushing things around on maps. We don't see Churchill. We barely glimpse the enemy,"" he told the Telegraph. ""It's a survival story.""
Historian Joshua Levine, who is also the film's historical consultant, told me that Dunkirk was a work of fiction and ""it isn't a film's job to tell the full story of Dunkirk... and nor, in the time available, could it even try to do so"".
""This film focuses on a few protagonists whose paths cross occasionally, each one of whom experiences just a tiny corner of the whole story. As Hilary Mantel says about historical fiction, 'The man who is fighting can't see over the hill, out of the trench.' What I'd love to see, though, is an Indian film about Dunkirk, or WW2 generally, and I sincerely hope Indian filmmakers are working on it.""
But what about the criticism that the role of Indian and their South Asian counterparts in WW2 has been forgotten?
Yasmin Khan says that their ""sheer scale of the contribution"" has become apparent in Britain in recent years. ""No longer is it simply an island story of heroic, plucky British fighting against Nazi-occupied continental Europe; it has now become increasingly customary for historians to refer to the contribution made by Asian, African and Caribbean servicemen in the 1940s"", she writes in her book.
A memorial to honour the role of these soldiers came up on London's Constitution Hill in 2002. There have been museum exhibitions, oral history projects and TV documentaries to ""reveal how crucial they [the soldiers] often were to the action, the sacrifices that they made in the face of terrible odds, and also to divulge individual stories of great bravery and intrepid action"".
""It is no longer true to suggest that this is an entirely forgotten story,""  she says.
Meanwhile, Indians are flocking to watch Dunkirk, which opened at 416 screens, including 10 Imax screens, across the country, on Friday.
Unlike most Hollywood films, Dunkirk hasn't been dubbed in any Indian language for wider viewership. Still, says Denzil Dias of Warner Brothers (India), the film raked in $2.4m (Â£1.84m) over the weekend. ""This is the biggest opening of an English language-only film in India,"" Mr Dias told me. Clearly, viewers are not fretting about the lack of Indian soldiers in Nolan's tour-de-force.","The Indian soldiers played a significant role in major battles like Tobruk, Monte Cassino, Kohima and Imphal during WW2. They also provided more than 2,500 mules to the war effort and were ""particularly cool under fire and well organised during the retreat"".

273,"Luis Suarez's glancing header from Neymar's left-wing free-kick put Barcelona ahead at the Nou Camp.
But in a frantic ending, Cristiano Ronaldo went close before Ramos headed home Luka Modric's free-kick to earn a point for Zinedine Zidane's La Liga leaders.
Leaders Real remain six points clear of defending champions Barca after 14 matches.
Barca were moments away from reducing the gap to three points when Real captain Ramos pounced to make it 33 games without defeat for his side.
Real are approaching the winter break in the driving seat, Barca having gone three matches without a league win.
Barca forward Neymar, who was one of six players booked, will be suspended for next Saturday's match at Osasuna.
The hosts started slowly and managed only one attempt on goal - a Lionel Messi free-kick was comfortably gathered by Keylor Navas - in a scrappy first half.
In contrast, Ronaldo had three attempts in the opening 45 minutes as Luka Modric dominated for Real in midfield.
While far from their fluid best, Barca were better after the break and went in front when Raphael Varane conceded a free-kick just outside his area and Suarez nodded home from close range.
Messi, who has now gone six games without scoring against Real in all competitions, missed a great chance to double the lead after a lovely pass from substitute Andres Iniesta, on his return from injury, before Ramos had the final say.
The 30-year-old defender is establishing a reputation for scoring crucial late goals in big games.
Ramos scored a 93rd-minute equaliser against Atletico Madrid to send the 2014 Champions League final into extra time before Real won.
He also forced extra time with a stoppage-time equaliser in the 2016 Super Cup final, which Real also went on to win.
This was a big test of character for Zidane and his players, and they emerged from it undamaged despite the absence of Gareth Bale, who continues his recovery from an ankle injury.
Real have taken 87 points from a possible 102 since Zidane took charge in January, including four from two games at the Nou Camp.
This draw was based on a steely determination and never-say-die spirit which was missing before Zidane's arrival.
His tactics worked a treat as Real nullified Barca's attacking threat in the first half, with Modric influential in central midfield alongside Mateo Kovacic on the left and Isco on the right.
Both teams are in Champions League action in midweek. Real Madrid must beat Borussia Dortmund at the Bernabeu on Wednesday at 19:45 GMT to finish top of Group F.

274,"After a dull first half Danny Ings came on to score his first Liverpool goal.
Russell Martin profited from Simon Mignolet's error on a corner to level, just before Sturridge came off.
Mignolet denied Matt Jarvis with a fine reflex save, Philippe Coutinho wasted a one-on-one while Ings almost rounded John Ruddy to score a late winner.
But Norwich held on for a deserved point as Liverpool's stuttering start to the season continued.
Liverpool have now taken eight points from their first six games of the Premier League season, as have Norwich, who were promoted as play-off winners from the Championship last season.
Analysis - fresh hope for new-look Reds with a formation that works
Relive Norwich's draw at Liverpool
The combination only lasted 45 minutes, with Christian Benteke replaced by Ings at half-time because of a tight hamstring.
Minor injury might explain the £32.5m summer signing's sluggish first-half performance, while Sturridge was making his first Liverpool appearance since 4 April after undergoing hip surgery in the United States.
Sturridge's first contribution was a back-heeled flick to play in James Milner but there was nothing slick about the 26-year-old's combination with Benteke.
Both strikers showed heavy touches as Liverpool laboured in front of goal, although Sturridge did force John Ruddy into a save with a powerful left-footed strike.
Ings's impact was practically immediate, the former Burnley striker breaking the deadlock two minutes and 54 seconds after coming on.
Having taken the lead, the home side's energy levels were far above those seen in the opening period, and Ings's running down the right wing almost fashioned an opening for Sturridge, making a dangerous run at the back post.
But arguably the best bit of attacking play came from Martin, who showed brilliant composure and technique to flick beyond the stricken Mignolet.
The Liverpool goalkeeper tried to clear a corner with a punch and could not make it back to his line to stop Martin's effort looping in - his third goal of the season.
Norwich captain Martin was late in joining up with his team-mates before the game because he returned to Norwich to be with his wife for the birth of their son.
The baby was not expected to arrive before next week, and Martin, 29, had travelled with the squad as arranged.
But after his wife went into labour he drove back to Norfolk on Saturday night, arriving at the hospital at four in the morning, and came back to rejoin his team-mates just over five hours later.
""My son was born at half past nine this morning and I had to come up on the plane today, I missed the captain's meeting,"" he told BBC Sport.
""I'm absolutely knackered now and need some sleep. We showed what we're about today. We've not got any superstars but we're a real team.
""That comes form the manager and his team. They've given us confidence and belief and everyone has been thriving since they came in.""

Imports shot up by 14.8%, compared with estimates of 8.5%, thanks to purchases of processing and assembly products.
Overall, China's trade surplus widened to $40.8bn (Â£31.5bn) from $38bn in April.
Data released on Thursday also showed China's foreign exchange reserves rose by more than expected in May as tougher capital restrictions took effect.
However, many analysts warn that China's growth is likely to slow gradually in coming quarters.
""Today's trade data surprised on the upside, but has not changed our overall view that real GDP growth likely peaked in the first quarter,"" investment bank Nomura said in a report.
Moody's Investors Service downgraded China's credit rating last month on concerns that its financial strength would be eroded in the coming years by rising debts.
Much of China's growth since the financial crisis has come from massive government-led stimulus spending on infrastructure.
But the rise of zombie factories and ghost cities, an increase in capital outflows and the collapse in commodity prices seem finally to be taking their toll.
China's government has been forced to take steps to cool the property market and clamp down on speculative market activity.

278,"The focus is on the great crested newt, a species classified as endangered under European law.
Natural England, a government body in charge of protecting wildlife, is in the process of putting forward new proposals.
These would make the current licensing system ""more flexible and strategic"".
It would mean that councils and developers no longer have to move individual great crested newts as long as they protect the biggest colonies and most important habitats.
The consultation will end on 7 April.
If there are ponds on a building site it is illegal to send the bulldozers in until experts have confirmed that there are no great crested newts.
This can be expensive and lead to lengthy delays for major building projects. Great crested newts are protected under the European Habitats Directive so a formal survey by licensed ecologists needs to be carried out.
This can only be done between mid-March and mid-June when great crested newts are in the water breeding.
Torches are shone in to the ponds at night to try to spot them and water plants have to be examined by hand for eggs.
If even a small number are found, then Natural England (NE) the government body that looks after wildlife in England must grant a licence to move the animals.
They can only be fenced, trapped and relocated in spring and summer as they hibernate during winter.
This can cost from £5,000 to £10,000 for even a small project. The fencing alone costs £5-£6 per meter and there is labour on top. This costs business tens of millions of pounds a year.
Now Natural England is proposing a new strategy. Its consultation document says, ""our proposals shift the focus away from protecting animals on development sites and towards improving populations in the wider local area"".
The benchmark will not be individual newts, it will be whatever is necessary to ""maintain the conservation status"" of the animals.
Great crested newts may not have to be moved if it would not ""contribute to the long term prospects of the local population.""
If a significant colony is found then a developer may build them an alternative habitat somewhere else.
The document acknowledges, ""that the proposed policy is likely to increase the mortality of European Protected Species on development sites"".
Andrew Sells, chairman of Natural England said: ""The current licensing system for European Protected Species in England is quite a rigid way of protecting great crested newts, placing the emphasis on individual newts, rather than the species as a whole.""
""By making the system more flexible and strategic, it will enable us to establish habitat for great crested newts, where their populations will most benefit from being in a wide network of habitat, rather than being squeezed in around development.""
Great crested newt populations have declined sharply and the species is now the most threatened species of newt at a global level in Western Europe.
In the UK they are still widely found although numbers have dropped mainly due to ponds in the countryside being filled in or neglected.
NE is currently undertaking a pilot project in Woking using DNA technology to find the most significant great crested newt colonies.
A simple water sample is taken and sent to a lab and this can show their presence or absence. It is quicker and cheaper than the traditional method. However, if a colony is found then the old ways must still be used to see how many there are.
The project is trying to establish where development on the site will have the least impact, to ensure that new habitats are built to accommodate the colonies.
The NE proposals have had a tentative welcome from conservationists. Stephen Trotter, the Wildlife Trust's Director, said:
""There is strong evidence to show that the health and wellbeing of the local people - and wildlife - who live in new housing estates is far better if high-quality green wild spaces are designed into schemes from the outset.""
""It is vital that, before the pilot is rolled out to new areas, the Woking trial develops strong scientific evidence and a robust methodology to show that it works for great crested newts and can be repeated elsewhere.
""Great crested newts are a rare species in Europe and it is important that Natural England takes time to get this right.""
John Dickson, chairman of the Reptile and Amphibian Group for Somerset said: ""I think great crested newts are probably slightly over protected. They are still quite widespread and fairly common in England.
""The reason that they are so highly protected is because it comes from European legislation where they are much more rare.""
""It's how this is done. I think it would be a great shame if everything became about saving the developers money.""
Sara King, senior consultant with ecological company Ecosulis and a great crested newt licensed surveyor, agrees that the current system is ""restrictive.""
""I think it as quite a promising development. Our values in our business are centred on benefitting ecology and wildlife. We don't see that putting fencing in and spending on that is going to greatly benefit great crested newts in the long run.
""So we think it is a promising thing to be looking at the great crested newt population as a whole.""
However, George Adams, Green Construction Champion for the Construction Industry Council believes that nothing should be done that could compromise any of the European Protected Species.
""The construction industry needs to be more sympathetic to our natural resources. Humanity currently outstrips the Earth by 50% more of its resources than the Earth can replenish, and the construction industry creates 40% of global emissions.
""It is the largest single contributor to humanity's responsibility for global warming. We have no right to cause endangered species to suffer. On Terminal 5 at Heathrow immense care and effort went into protecting the local wildlife.""

279,"The Garda (police) have been embroiled in a number of controversies recently.
On Tuesday, Taoiseach (prime minister) Enda Kenny announced an independent review of the force.
A second investigation will probe the wrongful convictions of almost 15,000 motorists, and apparent false data on breath tests.
Last week, it emerged that almost one million drink-driving tests recorded by police in the Republic of Ireland did not actually take place.
In addition, police have admitted a separate error that caused almost 15,000 wrongful traffic convictions.
Mr Kenny also said on Tuesday said the government continues to have confidence in Garda Commissioner Nóirín O'Sullivan.
Commissioner O'Sullivan was already facing questions over her leadership because of allegations of a smear campaign against a whistleblower, Sgt Maurice McCabe.
Sgt McCabe was one of two officers who raised concerns years ago about the alleged deletion of penalty points from the driving licences of well-connected offenders.
Speaking during Leaders' Questions in the Dail (parliament), Mr Kenny said of the independent review: ""We continue to see a list of unacceptable revelations about the operation of An Garda Siochana.
""The government believes that the level of public concern is now so profound that it's now time to conduct a thorough, comprehensive and independent, root-and-branch review of An Garda Siochana.""
Exact details of the independent review are to be outlined next week.
In the meantime, an external inquiry is being set up into the erroneous Garda statistics and prosecutions.

280,"More than 386,000 migrants passed through Hungary in 2015 before its borders were closed in October.
An organiser of the Paris attacks ""recruited"" some migrants from Budapest's main train station, Hungarian officials have said.
He then left Hungary with the men, PM Viktor Orban's chief of staff said, without providing more details.
A government spokesman confirmed to the Associated Press that the man was Salah Abdeslam, who remains on the run. The Paris attacks, on 13 November, killed 130 people.
Meanwhile, a migrant believed to be from Morocco has been electrocuted at the Greece-Macedonia border.
The man died after climbing onto the roof of a train carriage and touching an overhead cable during scuffles, local police said.
Macedonian authorities have only been letting in Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans who are fleeing conflict, sparking protests from groups of Pakistanis, Iranians and Moroccans.
Tear gas was fired on Thursday as police unsuccessfully moved to clear a border crossing blocked by those groups.
Some 5,000 people are now stuck at the border, including 43 busloads of Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans who arrived overnight.
Tear gas is fired, stones are thrown, but as darkness falls dozens of migrants are still blocking the border, refusing to move.
The UN has for now suspended food distribution because of safety concerns. Its store was looted this morning, and hundreds of Syrians who arrived overnight are sitting waiting. They are trapped with everyone else.
The situation on this border is not sustainable. The police have warned irregular migrants that they must go back to Athens, but no one seems to know how any of this should best be resolved.
In Hungary, national newspapers on Thursday carried full-page government adverts attacking the EU refugee relocation plan.
EU interior ministers approved the plan for mandatory quotas to distribute 120,000 refugees in September, despite opposition from several states including Hungary.
One message printed in a newspaper on Thursday read: ""The quota increases the terror threat!""
Announcing the court challenge, PM Orban said it was ""not enough to protest [at the EU plan], action must be taken"".
Slovakia filed a similar court challenge on Wednesday.
Under the EU quota system, Hungary is expected to take 306 refugees from Italy and 988 refugees from Greece.
It was originally considered one of the ""frontline"" states in the migrant crisis and the plan would have seen 54,000 refugees relocated from its territory.
However due to its rejection of the plan, that number will instead be transferred from Italy and Greece, and Hungary has to accept a quota of refugees.
Over the summer, thousands of migrants congregated at Keleti railway station in Budapest, hoping to travel onwards to Austria and Germany.
On Thursday Hungarian government spokesman Janos Lazar revealed Abdeslam had been at the station but did not specify when.
He also failed to say whether the men he left with took part in the November 13 attacks in Paris.
A French source told AFP that a car rented by Abdeslam had been in Hungary on 17 September.
Austrian authorities have said he was stopped at a traffic check in Austria on 9 September, though the car carrying him and two others was travelling south from Germany, rather than west from Hungary.","386,000 migrants passed through Hungary in 2015.

284,"The League Against Cruel Sports said it has video evidence suggesting hunts were routinely using dogs to hunt foxes and not merely ""flush"" them from cover for shooting, which is allowed.
The League's director said hunts were ""flouting the law with impunity"".
The Scottish Countryside Alliance said the allegations were politically motivated.
It added that a lack of prosecutions suggested the law was being complied with.
Scotland became the first UK nation to ban hunting with dogs in 2002, with England and Wales following two years later.
The League said it carried out surveillance on five recent hunts in Scotland between December 2015 and March 2015 and saw no shotguns used during 16 days of filming.
Robbie Marsland, director of the League in Scotland, added: ""Our footage suggests that at least half the hunts in Scotland are flouting the law with impunity and are operating as if the ban doesn't apply to them.
""While the hunts we observed claimed to be 'flushing to guns', our investigators did not see a single shotgun either used or even brandished.""
The video evidence does not include any footage of a fox being killed by dogs.
The Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002 states that a person who deliberately hunts a wild mammal with a dog is committing an offence.
An exception is made whereby dogs under control may be used ""to flush a fox or mink from below ground or...to flush a fox from an enclosed space within rocks or other secure cover above ground"".
This process is known as ""flushing to guns"".
The League is now calling for an amendment to the law to reduce the number of dogs used in flushing to guns to two and the addition of a clause outlawing reckless behaviour.
Campaigners will show MSPs a video containing some of the footage at Holyrood on Wednesday.
Information on one of the hunts has been passed to Police Scotland.
Jamie Stewart, director of the Scottish Countryside Alliance, which supports hunting foxes with dogs, called the current law ""unjustified"" but said it did at least allow hunts and hill packs to continue to deliver ""a much-needed service"" to livestock farmers.
He told the BBC he was ""appalled"" that campaigners were trying to change the law on the evidence of a video that was ""at best subjective, at worst contrived"".
He added: ""There have been no convictions relating to fox control with hounds which suggests compliance with the legislation and that Police Scotland and other agencies have effectively monitored the practices over the 13 or so years since implementation.
""The League Against Cruel Sports is a tiny organisation with a membership of less than 3,000 UK-wide.
""It has a political agenda which rejects the case for managing foxes entirely and has no interest in the economic and environmental wellbeing of rural Scotland.
""Serious animal welfare organisations recognise that the Act has achieved some level of balance.""
A Scottish government spokeswoman said there were no plans to amend current legislation.
She added: ""The offences laid out in the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002 are very clear.
""Evidence of criminal activity is a matter for Police Scotland, so as with any crime we would urge anyone with any information to inform the police immediately.""
Scottish Labour's rural affairs spokeswoman Sarah Boyack said the video evidence provided by the League was ""deeply concerning"" and urged ministers to consider the amendments.
The Conservatives have pledged to hold a  House of Commons vote on repealing the ban in England and Wales.
The SNP does not routinely vote on legislation that does not affect Scotland, but its MPs are being urged by campaigners to use their vote this time.

289,"The poll of more than 1,000 parents, by Churchill Home Insurance, also found 34% used alcohol as a bribe to encourage good behaviour.
It isn't illegal for children aged five and over to have alcohol at home, but government guidance says children under 14 who drink have increased health risks.
So why do some parents allow it?
Anne Atkins is a mother of five and author of the book Child Rearing for Fun: Trust Your Instincts and Enjoy Your Children.
She says she has given her children sips of wine, allowing her daughter a first taste when she was eight. Her daughter is now 13, and is allowed a little wine ""if we're celebrating"".
She believes the right approach is ""what the parents judge"" to be best.
""Of course it's alarming to think of parents giving alcohol as a bribe, but that could mean all sorts of things. It could mean 'You've passed your exams, let's open a bottle of Prosecco, would you like a little?'
""An alcohol-free childhood is fine, but alcohol is good for you [when] drunk and enjoyed correctly.
""But we have to acknowledge that booze is a huge problem in our society now.""
Heather Witherington, 47, a social worker from Daventry in Northamptonshire, was first given alcohol aged 10 by her father.
""My family is Irish so there's a big drinking culture. I remember being at family functions aged 10 and people teasing me about having a brandy, expecting to be told no,"" she says.
""But my dad would then say 'Yeah, she'll have one of them,' and I'd be given a martini and lemonade instead.
""My dad was always about experimenting in a safe way. I'd have drinks at barbecues and once I got drunk aged 12. I couldn't feel my knees. My dad told me I was a bit tiddly and that I couldn't have any more.""
Heather says she has three family members who have had problems with alcohol, and that she was encouraged to not follow their example.
""To some it might seem that I was encouraged to drink as a child, but in our eyes it was all about managing risks.""
Heather says she and her husband Richard allowed their 15-year-old son Callum to start drinking sips of lager and wine aged 10, and then have a shandy to himself soon afterwards.
Today she says Callum will share a bottle of beer with his dad while watching football on occasion, or at barbecues.
""He's now more mature about alcohol than some of his mates. He sees it all as the same, whereas ones who didn't drink when they were younger are looking to try new drinks and get hammered.
""He has still had some normal experimentation with alcohol, as many teenagers do, but he's much more aware of alcohol because he was introduced to it early.""
Dr Martin Scurr, a former GP, said he used to allow his children to drink.
But he changed his mind about this ""even though it means putting the brakes on ideas that, socially and culturally, have always been rather hallowed"".
He says the brain of a child coming into puberty is ""critically vulnerable"" to damage.
""That's a worry if you're introducing a chemical that's psychoactive, that's active on the brain,"" he says.
""It is a critical age and we need to think carefully about that, and the fact that we can disrupt the future structure and functioning of the brain by allowing children to take alcohol.""
Dr Scurr says alcohol has an ""allure"" for children of this age range, who like to take risks and look for new experiences.
He adds that while people in European nations have long allowed their children to drink watered-down alcohol, better medical understanding means caution should now be used and that people should not simply take ""a note out of past history"".
""Once you've introduced alcohol to children, they could then get enthusiastic. There has to be a balance.""
Dr Sarah Jarvis, medical advisor to alcohol education charity Drinkaware says, it is best to talk to your child about the risks associated with drinking.
""As a parent, you have more influence than you might think,"" she says.
""Your child is likely to come to you first for information and advice about alcohol, and you can help shape their attitudes and behaviour towards alcohol by being a role model for responsible drinking.""

It follows the deaths of two people and a number of accidents.
But Swansea council leader Rob Stewart said he would not consider a two-way traffic system until decisions had been made about the future of Kingsway.
The current traffic system on the road allows two lanes of all traffic to travel west on one side of the road, with two lanes of public transport - one going east and one west - on the other side.
In April, a coroner investigating the death of Daniel Foss, 37, after he was hit by a National Express bus, called for action to deal with ""serious design issues"" on the road.
Swansea council later installed barriers along the carriageway following the death of Sgt Louise Lucas in March, in a bid to prevent pedestrians crossing.

291,"India is the land of inventors and industry, spices and spirituality - and 1.3 billion human genomes. But although the subcontinent contributes around 20% of the world's population, the DNA sequences of its people make up around 0.2% of global genetic databases.
In a similar vein, 81% of the world's genomic information has been collected from people with European ancestry. Still, this is an improvement from a staggering 96% back in 2009.
At the same time, there's a growing interest in developing new, more effective therapies tailored to an individual's genetic makeup - an idea known as precision or personalised medicine.
Missing out on mapping worldwide genetic diversity is a big mistake, according to Sumit Jamuar, chief executive of Global Gene Corp.
It's a company aiming to democratise healthcare by capturing anonymised genetic data from populations around the world and share it with the global community of academic and pharmaceutical industry researchers. It will start by focusing on populations in South Asia.
""Healthcare is broken,"" Mr Jamuar says. ""We spend $1 trillion on drugs every year, of which 40% or more are deemed to be ineffective. That's $400bn wasted. What's more, the burden on healthcare systems is only going to increase.
""We realised that with the power and possibility of genomics and precision medicine, you can change the health outcome for any individual and allow them to have not just a longer but a better quality of life. What was lacking was genomic data to realise that promise, and that's what we've set out to achieve.""
As deaths from infectious diseases fall, particularly in the developing world, there's a rise in chronic illnesses such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes - something the World Health Organization (WHO) has described as a ""slow-motion catastrophe"".
Treatments for these conditions are moving away from ""one size fits all"", becoming more precisely targeted to an individual's genetic makeup. Yet these drugs are currently designed and tested on the basis of predominantly ""pale, stale and male"" genomic information, and may not work for people with regional variations in their DNA.
Mr Jamuar believes the key to fixing this problem lies in gathering genetic data - as much of it as possible - along with harnessing the technical tools to analyse and share it.
And with the cost of genome sequencing falling rapidly, with quotes for the $1,000 genome dropping to just $100 within a year or two, it's definitely doable.
""If we take the example of GPS technology, it used to just provide longitude and latitude. Now we have Google maps and that has changed everything,"" he explains.
""It allows us not to focus on what goes on underneath the technology, but how we can use it to navigate our way round the world. What we want to do is create a high-fidelity genomic map of the world. And instead of looking for things like restaurants or traffic in a city, we can look at mutations or diseases in different areas.""
Right now, Global Gene Corp is focusing its genomic firepower on India, although it has plans to expand into Africa and other parts of Asia. Other initiatives are also springing up to plug the global data gap.
For example, the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute'sAfrican Genome Variation Project is looking in depth at 2.5 million genetic variations in 100 people from more than 10 ethnic groups across sub-Saharan Africa.
Similarly, consumer genetics firm 23andMe recently launched a dedicated African Genetics Project. These populations are woefully under-represented in today's genomic databases, yet make up a significant and widely-dispersed fraction of the world's inhabitants, including many millions of African Americans.
At Stanford University in California, Prof Carlos Bustamante's Population Genomics and Global Health team is focusing on people from Mexico, South America, and the Caribbean. And in 2015, South Korea launched its own genomics project, initially aiming for 10,000 participants but planning to expand in the future.
But it's not as simple as just sequencing a load of people's genomes from different countries and sticking it all in a big database. At the relatively trivial end, genetic data gathered by different teams around the world may not be in the same format (akin to the old Mac versus PC incompatibility problem).
The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health - an international coalition formed to enable DNA data sharing - highlights the challenge of harmonising genomic data across countries that may have very different legal frameworks for gathering and managing data.
Then there's the question of storage: a single human genome contains roughly three gigabytes of data, and it quickly adds up. With plans in place to sequence tens or even hundreds of thousands of individuals around the world, keeping all this information safe and secure is a growing issue.
If these problems can be solved and researchers start filling databases with genetic information from under-represented countries, the potential impact is huge.
It costs around a billion dollars to develop a single new drug, but 95 out of every 100 promising candidates never make it to the end of the journey. Treatments that seem promising in identikit animals or cells in the lab often falter when faced with the genetically complex reality of human patients.
Understanding more about the impact of genetic variations on the function of potential drugs - or identifying population-specific targets - could help to cut the cost of failure in the pharmaceutical industry's development pathway. And purely from a business angle, more genomes mean more customers for novel treatments.
Most importantly, providing more tailored healthcare solutions for the diverse and growing global population has the potential to save lives on a grand scale.
""This is the future,"" says Mr Jamuar. ""Just imagine if we can change the health outcome for every individual - that is a phenomenal promise.""","Global Gene Corp aims to democratise healthcare by capturing anonymised genetic data from populations around the world and share it with the global community of academic and pharmaceutical industry researchers.

293,"Israel and Egypt maintain tight border restrictions on the coastal enclave, which have severely hampered reconstruction efforts. They say these are needed for security.
Although the UN brokered a deal to ease building material imports, progress has been slow.  Over 100,000 Palestinians remain homeless.
Since the Islamist group, Hamas, reinforced its power in Gaza in 2007, there have been three large-scale conflicts with its sworn enemy, Israel. But the 2014 war was the most deadly and devastating.
More than 2,200 Palestinians, mostly civilians, were killed, according to the UN.  On the Israeli side, 67 soldiers and six civilians were killed.
Israel said its offensive was to stop Palestinian militants firing rockets at its population and to destroy a network of tunnels designed for attacks.
About 170,000 homes and 360 factories in Gaza were damaged or lost. Key infrastructure was also hit and thousand of acres of farmland were ruined.
English teacher Abdul Karim Abu Ahmed lived with his wife and 11 children in a large house with a rose garden in Shejaiya, east of Gaza City.
They fled during the war as their neighbourhood - near the Israeli border - saw fierce fighting.  When they returned they found their home was reduced to rubble.
Most of their belongings including furniture, clothes and books were destroyed.
The family now lives in a small, cramped apartment.  Aid from the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, has helped cover rental costs.
There is a shortage of bulldozers in Gaza but last month, Mr Abu Ahmed was finally able to clear his plot of land.  He has plans for a new house and has been promised funds donated by Qatar.
""Since the war there have been a lot of obstacles that stop us rebuilding,"" the teacher says.  ""It's been very frustrating but I have hope and try to be patient.""
Israeli restrictions prevent so-called ""dual use"" materials from entering Gaza.  These include building supplies that could be used by militants to create new tunnels, or weapons and storage sites.
To allow reconstruction to take place the UN agreed a temporary Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism   (GRM) with the Israeli and Palestinian governments.
This brings in aggregate, steel bars and cement (known as ABC materials) via the Kerem Shalom commercial border crossing.
UN monitors have helped assess housing damage and needs.  Full details are kept in a computer database and the Israeli military has oversight of some information.
Palestinian ministries administer lists of individuals cleared to collect materials from approved vendors.  So far, about 90,000 Palestinians have been cleared to obtain supplies, mostly for small-scale repairs.
The UN Special Co-ordinator for the Middle East, Nikolei Mladenov, says delays have been caused by the huge scale of the task and the slow flow of promised foreign aid.
Renewed divisions between Hamas and the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, which was meant to station its security forces at Gaza's border crossings, added to complications.
However Mr Mladenov says he is ""quite hopeful"" the reconstruction mechanism will show its effectiveness ""in the next few months"".  A new process should simplify approvals for new houses.
Ultimately, the UN and international aid agencies continue to call for a lifting of the blockade.  They say this is the only way to bring in all the materials needed to repair homes and infrastructure and revive the local economy.
The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) chairs the so-called Shelter Cluster, a group of UN agencies and non-governmental organisations working on housing in Gaza.
It calculates that only 7.5% of building supplies that are needed are currently entering the Palestinian territory each day.
""If we look at the import of ABC materials just through the GRM then it will take 19 years just to reconstruct what was destroyed last year,"" says Vance Culbert, NRC country director for Palestine.
""If we look at the outstanding damage for previous conflicts we're up to 22 years and if you look at the overall housing shortage in Gaza then it will take 76 years.""
For now, homeless Gazans stay with relatives or live in overcrowded rented accommodation, donated caravans or the ruins of their properties.
There is huge frustration compounded by shortages of electricity and water and the dire economic situation, which sees 80% of the population reliant on aid.
IMF figures put unemployment at 43% and 60% among young people.
Without long-term political solutions to solve Gaza's underlying problems, many warn of social unrest, instability and the increased risk of further hostilities.","The Gaza Strip, home to over 100,000 Palestinians, has been severely impacted by the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas.

Dale Gorman was given time and space down the right to pick his spot and cross perfectly for Godden to head past Barry Roche from six yards out.
Ben Kennedy then added a second just before the hour with a special strike. The midfielder tried his luck from 30 yards with a left-footed curler that gave home keeper Roche no chance as it dipped under the crossbar and ended up in the back of the net.

301,"Operator Midland Expressway Limited (MEL) has agreed to let members of the Road Haulage Association access the route free of charge throughout July.
The trial will see if using the road, instead of the M6, benefits businesses.
The road opened in 2003 and links junction 11a of the M6 near Cannock, Staffordshire, to Junction 3a at Coleshill, Warwickshire.
The Black Country LEP, The Association of Black Country Authorities (ABCA) and the Black Country Chamber of Commerce have been lobbying for better use of the road to help with network congestion.
Colin Leighfield, chair of Black Country Chamber of Commerce's transport group, said: ""This is an important and long overdue first step in maximising the potential of the toll road, which is one of our region's most under-utilised assets.
""Evidence from members demonstrates that regular use of the toll road for most freight and logistics firms is just not financially viable at current prices.""
By Peter PlisnerBBC Midlands Transport Correspondent
For a company that makes its money from charging drivers, including lorries, to use a 27-mile stretch of highway it seems strange that it is now giving it away for free.
Add to that the fact that the M6 Toll has struggled to make a profit since it opened and the decision to allow HGV's to use it for nothing seems bizarre.
However, stand on any bridge above the road and you can't fail to notice the lack of HGV traffic.
The problem is at £11 one-way it is expensive and with fuel costs rising it is a luxury many haulage firms can not afford.
It is thought that the move by Midland Expressway will help to promote the road amongst those firms who don't use it and in the long-term help encourage more HGV traffic in the future.
Currently, the standard toll for a car on weekdays is £5.50 and £11 for an HGV.
Mr Leighfield said that the first indication to measure the trial by is if there are more vehicles using the toll and then feedback by the Road Haulage Association.
Nick Payne, Road Haulage Association Midlands (RHA) and western regional director said: ""Hopefully the members will see the benefit of using the toll road.
""Obviously it's good for both of us and in that respect, it will help them [Midland Expressway] get new leads for their database and it will also help our members check whether or not it's a viable proposition for them.
""We negotiated on behalf of the members to make their businesses hopefully more viable with regards to saving time and money by using the shorter, quicker route, and hopefully it will make a difference to them to the point where they will actually want to use it on an ongoing basis.""","Midland Expressway Limited (MEL) has agreed to let members of the Road Haulage Association access the route free of charge throughout July.

The service included the release of 22 white doves, one for each year of his life.
The hair stylist from Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, made an impression on all who met him with his fun-loving character, amplified by his brightly-coloured hair and lip stud.
He dreamed of becoming a well-known hairdresser and travelling the world.
On the morning of 7 July 2005, he and his friend Patrick Barnes, 22, boarded the Tube at King's Cross on the Piccadilly Line.
Mr Beer was on his way to work at a salon in Knightsbridge but a bomb went off moments after the train pulled out of the station.
At the inquest, Peter Taylor, one of the first paramedics on the scene, said leaving Mr Beer, who called out for help as he made his way through the carriage but later stopped breathing, was the ""hardest decision I have ever had to make"".
His close friend Mr Barnes survived the blast. During the inquest, it emerged that some of Mr Beer's last words included reassuring Mr Barnes that he was not going to die.
Mr Beer's sister, Stacy, then 24, had taken the men to Borehamwood station and when she heard about the bombs she sent a text message to Mr Barnes to make sure the pair were all right.
A distressed phone call followed and Mr Barnes told her he had lost sight of her brother in the aftermath of the blast.
Family and friends searched hospitals until they received confirmation of their worst fears three days after the attacks.
Mr Beer lived with his parents Kim and Phil and his four sisters, Michelle, then 25, Stacy, Angelina, 15 and one-year-old Lilymay.
In a statement read out at the inquest five years after his death, Stacy Beer said: ""Our lives seem quiet and empty since Phil has gone.
""There is always a dark shadow over our family, as a huge part of our family is always missing.
""When our family share happy occasions, there is always a constant reminder that Phil is not here to share them with us, such as the birth of my first baby.
""We suffer every day with the pain of losing our little brother in such a horrific way, but we also have to watch our parents suffer, as they are unable to come to terms with losing their only son, a piece of them died the day Philip was taken from our family.""
Since leaving school, Mr Beer worked in several salons, including John Frieda and Alberto Gianni.
His colleagues at Sanrizz in Knightsbridge, where he had been for just over a week, described Mr Beer as ""a born entertainer"" who ""lived life to the full"".

Gonzalo Higuain pulled one back, but Paulo Sousa's men held out.
With Roma winning 1-0 at Udinese earlier on Sunday, Max Allegri's side have seen their advantage at the top cut significantly, although they have a game in hand on the three sides immediately behind them.
Juve had won their first two matches of 2017, swatting aside Bologna 3-0 in the league and defeating Atalanta 3-2 in the Coppa Italia.
But they were second best to a Fiorentina side with a point to prove after underperforming in Serie A this season.
Matias Vecino hit the post for the home side in the first 10 minutes after a mazy run, and Juve keeper Gianluigi Buffon, returning after a bout of flu, had to get down well to beat out a Federico Chiesa shot.
Higuain had a penalty appeal rightly rejected just before half-time when his close-range shot was charged down by the thigh, not the hand, of Max Olivera.
Buffon made a fine save to stop Bernardeschi's cushioned volley, but was caught out as Badelj, linked with Chelsea, floated in a ball that eluded the stretching Chiesa in the middle and bounced into the net.
Higuain tapped in from close range after Sami Khedira's cross came to him via two deflections, and then sparked a goalmouth scramble after his header from a free-kick bounced loose off goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu.
But the home side should have had a third goal in stoppage time, as Kalinic played substitute Josip Ilicic clear, only for the Slovenian midfielder to mess up as he tried to go round Buffon, running the ball out of play.

An independent panel found Mr Colclough guilty of breaking anti-doping rules.
He had denied the charges and said he had not intended to play rugby again.
UK Anti-Doping (UKAD), which brought the charges, said the eight-year ban was the largest to be handed down in the UK for a first offence.
The charges were considered by the National Anti-Doping Panel, an independent tribunal responsible for determining anti-doping disputes in sport in the UK.
UKAD's Graham Arthur said: ""An independent panel has imposed a significant ban on this athlete (Mr Colclough), the largest yet to be handed down in the UK for a first offence. It is a significant case for a number of reasons.
""Firstly, it was through our strong relations with the UK Border Force that the case was first brought to our attention.
""Secondly, this finding demonstrates that everyone in sport has a responsibility to anti-doping, no matter what the level of engagement.""
Mr Colclough, a former hooker, played for Welsh Premiership club Swansea RFC more than 100 times but told the tribunal he retired in December 2007 due to a neck injury.
He had registered with his local rugby club Morriston in the hope of playing again but was advised not to due to the injury.
However he was still registered as a player with the Welsh Rugby Union, the panel was told.
In an email to the tribunal, Mr Colclough said in 16 years as a rugby union player he was ""completely clean from using any form of banned product"".
In 2012, Mr Colclough founded Dragon Nutrition Ltd (DNL) in Swansea which distributed muscle-building supplements.
In an email to the panel, he wrote: ""I do not condone doping in sport and the products we sell are aimed at those wanting to build up their muscle mass and improve the look of their physique.
""We have a warning both on our site with the product description and on the label itself that states they should not be used by athletes in drug-tested competitions.""
But the anti-doping panel found him guilty of committing anti-doping rule violations involving the possession and trafficking of steroids via DNL.
He is banned from all sport until 13 November 2021.
One of the charges related to 19-year-old Scottish player Sam Chalmers who in 2013 was banned from playing for two years for using steroids.
The tribunal had been told that Sam Chalmers, the son of former Scotland and Lions fly-half Craig Chalmers, had bought the product from Mr Colclough's company.
But the panel said it could not be ""comfortably satisfied"" that Mr Colclough's firm had supplied the steroids in the player's positive test.
The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) said it took anti-doping offences very seriously, and it worked closely with those agencies involved such as UKAD.
""The WRU condemns any violation of anti-doping rules, whether committed by an athlete, coach, administrator or anyone involved in rugby at whatever level,"" said a spokesperson.
""The WRU has an active education programme in place with players from the senior national team through to the semi-professional tier of Welsh rugby and works to educate and raise awareness throughout the club game.
""While this case is not related to an individual currently playing rugby in Wales, the WRU urges every player to be aware of their responsibility when considering taking any kind of substance or supplement.""
The UK Border Force was involved in the interception of a package at an airport.
A spokesman said: ""Border Force, working with UK Anti-Doping, has helped prevent a quantity of banned anabolic steroids from being imported into the UK and used illegally in sport.

311,"The country as we know it today was actually formed quite recently, when south Yemen and north Yemen - which believed the country should be run in different ways - joined together in 1990, after many years of fighting.
However, since then the fighting has not stopped, which has made life for those living in the country very difficult.
Find out more about why there is still a conflict in Yemen with Newsround's guide.
Despite joining together in 1990, the north and south of the country still disagreed with each other.
Fighting between the government and anti-government fighters called the Houthi (also known as 'rebels') continued.
The situation reached a peak in 2011 when protests led to the president at the time, Ali Abdallah Saleh, resigning and his deputy, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, taking over.
However, the fighting still didn't stop, as Mr Hadi struggled to keep everyone in the country happy.
In 2014, the country descended into civil war, as the rebels took over the capital city of Yemen called Sanaa.
This civil war is still going on today.
When the Houthi took over Sanaa, President Hadi fled to the country next door, called Saudi Arabia, which still supports him.
He set up a temporary capital in a different city in Yemen called Aden. He has still not been able to return to Sanaa.
At the moment, the country is locked in a difficult situation.
The Houthi rebels don't accept that Hadi's government makes their rules. They believe in a new ruling group, with a leader called Mohammed Ali al-Houthi.
However, much of the rest of the world - including the UK and the US - do not accept this. They both support the government in Saudi Arabia.
Earlier in 2016, the United Nations - which is an organisation which works to bring peace - helped to make the two sides talk to each other to try to sort out their problems.
But after three months, the talking stopped and the fighting continued.
Another thing making the situation in Yemen more difficult is that it has become a place for extreme groups, like Al-Qaeda and the group that calls itself Islamic State, to base themselves and grow stronger.
It has also always been one of the poorest Arab countries, which has made it difficult to deal with the situation.
The fighting has had a devastating impact on normal people trying to live their lives in Yemen.
Charities are working to try to help them.
A UK organisation called the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC), which represents 13 aid charities, launched a big appeal asking for people to donate money to help make sure that people in Yemen have what they need to live.
At the end of 2016, the British Red Cross, a charity represented by the DEC, said: ""The ongoing conflict in Yemen has devastated millions of people's lives.""
""More than half the population don't have enough food. Almost a quarter face starvation. Families are living with no water or electricity.""
Restricted deliveries of food and fuel, and roads and buildings being destroyed, has led to as many as 21 million people not having the basics essentials they need to live.
With airports closed and borders blocked, many people are unable to leave the country, despite the problems.
Thousands of people have also been killed and injured in the fighting.

In the context of what is happening in New Zealand, this is rugby small fry, but nobody will convince any of the Scots or Italians of that when they run out in the National Stadium at around 8pm local time (13:00 BST).
For Scotland, who are trying to get off to a flyer under Townsend, and Italy, who are attempting to rebuild under Conor O'Shea, this is the biggest of big deals.
The 55,000-capacity stadium will struggle to get a crowd above 10,000, but the significance of the Test is sizeable all the same.
This is a new Scotland regime - not just Townsend, but also Dan McFarland, who is now in charge of the forwards, and Mike Blair, who is skills coach - and they have made no secret of the fact that they don't just want to win, they want to win playing a fast and furious brand of rugby.
""It will be hot,"" said John Barclay, who captains the side in Greig Laidlaw's absence. ""But we back ourselves fitness-wise to adapt to the conditions.
""We want to play fast rugby. We're not shy about saying that. That is how we want to play the game.
""The key thing is to do everything with speed. Hopefully, you'll see a different way we approach it and sometimes it may not come off, but as long as the intent is there to play with speed, we'll reap the benefits of that.""
Vern Cotter's Scotland were not exactly slouches in the way they played, but upping the intensity has been a feature of the way Townsend has prepared his players in their weeks together.
""Under Vern, we played quick rugby as well,"" said Barclay. ""The intensity was high under him and he understood as a nation that that's how we have to play. It's how Gregor played at Glasgow and he's placed more of an emphasis on it.""
Both line-ups have altered substantially since Scotland's 29-0 win at Murrayfield at the tail-end of the Six Nations. Townsend and his counterpart, O'Shea, have made nine changes apiece, some enforced, some tactical.
As much as Scotland will miss their three Lions - Stuart Hogg, Tommy Seymour and Laidlaw - as well as the rested Jonny Gray, the most grievous loss of all is Italy's. Sergio Parisse, the colossus of Stade Francais, has been given the summer off.
Scotland will be expected to win this with plenty to spare. The Italians are drawn largely from Zebre and Treviso, with 13 of their starting 15 playing their club rugby with the failing Pro12 sides.
Treviso finished 10th in the league last season, Zebre finished bottom in 12th. Between them, they won only eight Pro12 games in the campaign just gone. They lost 36.
O'Shea has an Everest-like mountain ahead of him as he attempts to change the fortunes of not just his Test team but everything that happens - or doesn't happen - underneath the top level.
For Scotland, the fascination will be seeing if they can deliver the increased tempo they've all been talking about.
Townsend is also exploring ways of increasing his player depth. Duncan Taylor, a wonderfully versatile footballer, is being given a run at full-back, while Damien Hoyland is given a chance on the wing.
This is a big day for Hoyland, who was viewed as the coming man last summer when selected to play against Japan. He hasn't been seen in a Scotland jersey since.
Townsend is not blessed with a lot of quality wide men. He could do with Hoyland laying down a marker against Italy.
WP Nel's return after a year out of the team with injury will have had Townsend paying homage to the rugby gods. If Scotland are to play at pace then they're going to need a stable set-piece and Nel is as formidable a tighthead as there is in the northern hemisphere. Had poor fortune not befallen him, he would surely be in New Zealand right now with the Lions.
Townsend has gone with a Gray-free second-row - Richie injured and Jonny rested. It's the first time in two years that neither Gray has started a Test for Scotland.
The new partnership is Tim Swinson and Ben Toolis. It's a combination that promises much given their club form of last season. Swinson was also terrific off the bench for Scotland in the Six Nations.
Barclay spoke on Friday about the 29-0 game at Murrayfield, Cotter's last as coach.
""The first half was very wet and it dictated quite a boring game with kicking and territory,"" he said. ""The second half opened up a bit.
""You have to expect the unexpected with Italy. It's hard to predict what they are going to do, so we've just focused on ourselves. We have a new coach, new systems, new calling structures.""
New players too. To Barclay at any rate.
There's a collection of youngsters in the squad that he's only just getting to know, the latest one being Lewis Carmichael, the young Edinburgh lock who has been loaned to Western Force in Perth in Super Rugby since March. With more of an eye on the future than the present, Carmichael has been invited to train with the squad to experience an international environment.
""That's why I love touring,"" Barclay added. ""There are only five guys who were on the Australia tour five years ago. It's a bit surreal.
""There are guys here I don't know well and they don't know me very well. When I left Scotland (for the Scarlets in 2013), some of the guys were just young pups in the academy.""
Barclay leads them on Saturday. Anything other than a comprehensive Scotland win will be deemed a shock.

314,"The captain of Wales in both codes of rugby had wrestled with his sexuality for his whole career; now he had reached the end of the road.
His wife Jemma, a childhood sweetheart, had left Thomas three months after he told her he was gay. Suicide now seemed the only option.
He wanted to die, but he wanted to be remembered with pride rather than shame - and that meant wearing his Wales suit.
In a wide-ranging interview on BBC Radio 5 Live, Thomas - whose new book 'Proud' was released this week - says he contemplated suicide so he would ""not be part of a horrible world I had created around me"".
He said: ""It is difficult for people to realise what is on the mind of someone who wants to die. For me, I had so much pride, but so much hatred for what I was.
""When I was found I wanted my parents to look at me and be proud of what I had created rather than the embarrassment of what I created. The rugby theme played a massive part of my life and I wanted it to be a massive part of my death.""
It is now five years since the 36-year-old, who retired in 2011, became the highest-profile sportsman in the UK to reveal he was gay.
Thomas' glittering career was defined by the 200 points he scored for his country as he became the first rugby union player to earn 100 caps for Wales.
He was also selected three times for the Lions and when he switched codes the utility back scored three tries during four rugby league matches for his country.
Thomas, who played for Cardiff Blues, Bridgend and Toulouse in rugby union as well as Crusaders in the Super League, revealed that he hid his sexuality from everyone - until admitting his secret to his wife eight years ago.
He said: ""My career life was very public, but behind what happened on television and wearing my Wales rugby jersey with pride I was slowly dying.
""I'm not sure if it was because I was gay that I felt such depression, it was just that I was lying to everyone.""
Thomas is now in a happy relationship with Ian Baum and remains on good terms with Jemma, who has since remarried.
He now works for a teaching company and offers educational talks in schools about his life.
He added: ""I have a life now defined by my personality, not by my sexuality, defined by what I am capable of, and defined hopefully trying to make other people's lives better and give strength to others. I know what it is like to be one kid lost in the valleys, not in the big cities where people feel protected.""
Thomas also admitted his first gay encounter as an 18-year-old working as a postman left him feeling ""disgusted"" and how he used away games and fake stag weekends to pick up men in London's gay scene.
Thomas was known in rugby union by his nickname 'Alfie', but to him it was an opportunity to hide behind an image he could create.
He said: ""Alfie was an archetypal rugby player. I created him to be the macho man, the guy who never takes a step back, the last one drinking, the one who watches the back of his team-mates. He was a part of who Gareth Thomas was, but I expected him to be what everybody thought I was in real life.
""For the first 35 years of my life I was more a character of somebody else (rather than) who I actually am.""
Thomas revealed that he surrounded himself with his wife's clothes that were hanging in a wardrobe and sprayed her favourite perfume in his house after she left him. He says he did this to remind him of the one person in his life who ""had been there for him all the time"".
He explained: ""It was a grieving moment when she left. I wanted that presence, I wanted her to still be there. I would even call out her name. They may leave, but a part of them is still left behind. I hoped to wake up and it was all a dream, but when the reality kicks in, it kicks in hard.
""I felt by lying and tying myself up in knots I had created a mess for people around me, people closest to me. I didn't care about myself, if I died or was hurt, it was irrelevant. Irrelevant. My wife, family, close friends and team-mates made my life great and were relevant, but I was managing to turn their lives into hell.""
Thomas says he was at his lowest ebb after leading Wales to a 29-29 draw with Australia at the Millennium Stadium in 2006, with the anxiety over his sexuality having caused him to lose 14 pounds in weight.
After the game Australia assistant coach Scott Johnson walked in to the dressing room to shake his hand and, holding back the tears, Thomas told the former Wales and Ospreys coach that his wife had left him. Johnson suspected what had happened, and arranged for long-standing team-mates Stephen Jones and Martyn Williams to comfort him at Wales' team hotel.
Thomas recalled: ""I had dreaded it. I had been drinking and chain smoked over what the guys would think, but they tapped me on the back and said, 'don't worry, let's have a beer'. These guys I had respected so much had accepted me, it meant so much. It was a massive weight lifted off my shoulders to have the rugby world accept me.""

The report looks at how the UK's mix of fixed and wireless communication networks are developing.
Ofcom said despite the fall, ""much more"" had to be done to improve the UK's communications infrastructure.
""Mobile and broadband coverage continued to grow this year, but too many people and businesses are still struggling for a good service,"" said Steve Unger, Ofcom's director of strategy, in a statement. ""We think that is unacceptable.""
Ofcom's report found a significant urban-rural divide on higher speed broadband. About 25% of properties in rural areas, more than 900,000 homes, are too far from telephone exchanges to get a 10mbps service. This speed is now necessary to meet the needs of typical households, it said.
Estimates by Ofcom suggest it would take Â£1.1bn to boost networks in remote areas so they run as fast as the ""decent"" 10mbps networks in towns and cities.
The report noted that one-third of UK homes, 9.1 million, have signed up for superfast services - designated as 30mbps or higher.
Ofcom said the UK's mobile networks also needed to tackle areas where coverage fell short. Its report estimates that only 40% of the UK's landmass can get 4G mobile signals from all four operators. This was an improvement on 2015, when only 8% enjoyed that ""total"" coverage, it said.
Ofcom is now talking to network operators about ""radical and ambitious"" ways to fill the ""not-spots"" and to boost speeds.
""The advent of 5G draws ever closer, which seems extraordinary when a third of the UK's geography can't even get a call signal from all four networks,"" said Ernest Doku, mobiles expert at USwitch, in a statement.
""It's a bitter irony for anyone living in a coverage blackspot, who'd gladly settle for a voice call let alone 5G,"" he added.
The Ofcom report is published soon after a separate report from the UK's National Infrastructure Commission called mobile coverage on trains and motorways ""appalling"".

318,"For once, the British weather attempted to emulate the gauzy Californian heat in which the record was made, as King performed hits including I Feel The Earth Move and You've Got A Friend in the late-evening breeze.
The crowd, who had paid up to Â£249 for the show, seemed to know every word.
""This is so amazing,"" said King, now aged 74, from behind her piano.
Some 65,000 fans attended the sold-out concert, which was part of the BST festival in London's Hyde Park. It was their first chance to see King play the UK since her City Streets tour reached the Albert Hall in 1989.
Although the set remained faithful to King's 1971 masterpiece, there were a few surprises along the way.
King duetted with her daughter, Louise Goffin, on Where You Lead - using alternate lyrics written in 2000, when the song became the theme to the hit US TV show Gilmore Girls.
Later, King was accompanied by a recording of her younger self on a stirring version of (You Make Me Feel Like A) Natural Woman.
It highlighted that King's voice now carries a pronounced rasp (she also strained for some of the higher, sustained notes) but her intimate, heartfelt delivery remained intact.
""So this is what 74 looks like,"" she joked at one point. ""I'm old and embracing it.""
King's audience has aged gracefully with her - and they certainly could not have been more different from the crowd that watched Florence + The Machine on the same stage 24 hours earlier.
Hyde Park was strewn with picnic blankets, while the queue for coffee ran deeper than the one for beer. For decibel-damaged concert veterans, the entire show was even illustrated by sign language interpreters on the big screens.
But the affection for King and her expressive, emotive songs, was undeniable.
In a taped introduction, Sir Elton John said: ""I can't thank Carole King enough, because without her, I would never have wanted to write songs.""
""There wasn't a woman on the planet Earth... sometimes your mom... who didn't take Tapestry to their heart,"" added actor Tom Hanks. ""It was one of those timeless LPs.""

In an attempt to explain Tapestry to its readers, the NME recently described the album as ""Adele's 21 for your nan,"" but even that undersells its impact.
Largely self-written, it helped establish a template for female singer-songwriters which endures to this day, while King became the first woman to win the coveted record of the year award at the Grammys.
Selling 25 million copies worldwide, the album clocked up the longest-ever run on the US Billboard charts (until Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon overtook it a few years later) and, in 2003, it was added to the US National Recording Registry.
Tapestry never quite reached those heady heights in the UK - it peaked at number four over here - but the songs, particularly It's Too Late, are enduring radio hits.
Speaking to BBC 6 Music ahead of the show, King acknowledged that her concert would need to incorporate some of her other hits, saying: ""It would be a very short set if I only did Tapestry.""
Those came in the form of a medley of songs she wrote with the late Gerry Goffin - including Take Good Care Of My Baby; Might As Well Rain Until September; Something Tells Me I'm Into Something Good and One Fine Day.
She also played Chains under a projection of the Cavern Club logo - acknowledging the Beatles, who covered the song on their debut album, Please Please Me.
The concert ended with The Loco-Motion and a reprise of I Feel The Earth Move, accompanied by the cast of Beautiful - the West End musical based on King's music.
Overwhelmed by the response, the singer gave a final, impromptu rendition of You've Got A Friend, changing the lyrics to say: ""Thank you for welcoming my friends and family. I love you, London Town.""
Earlier in the day, singer-songwriter Don Henley played at the festival, with a set featuring both his solo hits and songs he recorded with The Eagles.
After an enthralling version of Hotel California, the singer paid tribute to his former bandmate Glenn Frey, who died in January, aged 67.
""This has been a difficult year in our camp,"" said Henley, introducing The Eagles' breakthrough hit, Desperado. ""Thank you for all your messages of support and love.

320,"The work in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) looked at hundreds of trials involving nearly 340,000 patients to assess the merits of exercise and drugs in preventing death.
Physical activity rivalled some heart drugs and outperformed stroke medicine.
The findings suggest exercise should be added to prescriptions, say the researchers.
Experts stressed that patients should not ditch their drugs for exercise - rather, they should use both in tandem.
Too few adults currently get enough exercise. Only a third of people in England do the recommended 2.5 hours or more of moderate-intensity activity, such as cycling or fast walking, every week.
In contrast, prescription drug rates continue to rise.
There were an average of 17.7 prescriptions for every person in England in 2010, compared with 11.2 in 2000.
For the study, scientists based at the London School of Economics, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute at Harvard Medical School and Stanford University School of Medicine trawled medical literature to find any research that compared exercise with pills as a therapy.
They identified 305 trials to include in their analysis. These trials looked at managing conditions such as existing heart disease, stroke rehabilitation, heart failure and pre-diabetes.
When they studied the data as a whole, they found exercise and drugs were comparable in terms of death rates.
But there were two exceptions.
Drugs called diuretics were the clear winner for heart failure patients, while exercise was best for stroke patients in terms of life expectancy.

Amy Thompson, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said that although an active lifestyle brings many health benefits, there is not enough evidence to draw any firm conclusions about the merit of exercise above and beyond drugs.
""Medicines are an extremely important part of the treatment of many heart conditions and people on prescribed drugs should keep taking their vital meds. If you have a heart condition or have been told you're at high risk of heart disease, talk to your doctor about the role that exercise can play in your treatment.""
Dr Peter Coleman of the Stroke Association said exercise alongside drugs had a vital role that merited more research.
""We would like to see more research into the long-term benefits of exercise for stroke patients.
""By taking important steps, such as regular exercise, eating a balanced diet and stopping smoking, people can significantly reduce their risk of stroke.""

On Monday, the governor of Nineveh province urged residents to ""stand firm"". But within hours, Atheel al-Nujaifi was forced to flee before the provincial government's headquarters was overrun by hundreds of men armed with rocket-propelled grenades, sniper rifles and machine-guns.
By Tuesday, tens of thousands of residents had left for the nearby Kurdish-controlled region as the militants seized Mosul's airport, army operations centre and other installations. They also set fire to police stations and freed hundreds of detainees. Police and soldiers dropped their weapons and abandoned their posts as the assault became a rout.
Convoys of militants moved southwards on Wednesday, first attacking the town of Baiji and then reportedly overrunning Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit, the administrative capital of Salahuddin province.
In pictures: Iraqis flee Mosul
Profile: Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIS)
Mosul is the second city to fall to ISIS this year, after Falluja. However, its loss is much more serious for the government, as it is the main city of northern Iraq and a major political and economic centre, with a population of 1.8 million. It is also a gateway to Syria and Turkey.
After the US-led invasion in 2003, Mosul became a bastion of resistance to the occupation, which its Sunni Arab majority opposed and Kurdish minority supported. Years of bombings and shootings by militants linked to al-Qaeda led to an exodus of thousands of people.
It was not until 2009 that a semblance of normality returned to Mosul, but jihadists maintained a firm hold. Sectarian violence increased after US troops withdrew in 2011. It has surged since early 2013 when Shia Prime Minister Nouri Maliki's government launched an offensive against ISIS while also moving against Sunni opposition figures and protesters.
Analysis: How to recover Iraq's second city
Paragliding in Mosul, a way to shake off recent past
The prime minister has pressed parliament to declare a 30-day state of emergency that would give security forces the ""necessary powers"" to regain control.
A vote will be held on Thursday. Mr Maliki also said citizens would be armed to fight the militants.
The sudden collapse of the security forces in Mosul alarmed the US. It called on the Iraqi government to ""step up to the plate"", warning that ISIS was ""a threat to the entire region"". It pledged to help Baghdad ""push back this aggression"".
The Iraqi government is believed to have about 930,000 security personnel under its command, so on paper they ought to be able to easily overcome the hundreds of militants who attacked Mosul.
However, the same might have been said in late December after ISIS militants and allied tribesmen seized parts of Ramadi, the capital of the western province of Anbar, and most of the nearby city of Falluja amid clashes triggered by the clearance of two protest camps.
Mr Maliki has vowed to crush the militants, but they are still in control six months on, holding off troops. The UN says the fighting in Anbar has displaced some 480,000 people.
Soldiers have become disillusioned by the conflict against ISIS and brutal attacks by the group - including beheadings and crucifixions - leading many to desert. Commanders told the New York Times they were losing as many as 300 soldiers a day to desertions, deaths and injuries.
Analysis: Anbar violence goes beyond sectarian conflict
Violence in Iraq sparks new sectarian displacement
Quick guide: Sunnis and Shias
In 2009, then CIA Director Michael Hayden said al-Qaeda was ""on the verge of a strategic defeat in Iraq"". Today, its successor controls territories stretching for hundreds of miles through Nineveh, Anbar and into Syria, where it hopes to establish an Islamic state.
ISIS has gained strength and momentum from the situation in Syria, from where it has transferred recruits, sophisticated weapons and resources to fight in Iraq since 2012.
It has also skilfully exploited the political stand-off between the central government and the minority Sunni Arab community, which complains that Mr Maliki is monopolising power and targeting them by pursuing policies like the mass arrests in the name of fighting terrorism.
According to the UN, more than 8,860 people were killed in Iraq in 2013 - the highest number of deaths since the peak of the sectarian insurgency between 2006 and 2008. So far this year, more than 4,700 have died.

340,"John Lewis, director of Wildlife Vets International, said there was evidence that Indonesian tigers were at risk.
Canine distemper virus has evolved in recent decades from infecting only dogs to affecting other animal groups.
Dr Lewis plans to work with Indonesian vets to develop a strategy to protect the nation's tigers from the virus.
A close relative of measles, Canine distemper virus (CDV) was first described at the beginning of the 20th Century and has been cited as contributing to the demise of the thylacine (commonly known as the Tasmanian tiger as a result of the black stripes on its back).
""If you wind the clock back about 30 or 40 years, it was a dog disease - it was a canine virus and only affected dogs,"" Dr Lewis explained.
""But in the intervening years, the virus has evolved and has changed its pattern of animals it can infect to include marine mammals (such as seals) and big cats.""
Reservoir dogs
He told BBC News that CDV needed a reservoir, like a population of dogs, to remain effective as a pathogen.
These conditions were present when the first case of the disease affecting wild big cats was documented, he recalled.
""In the mid-1990s, in the Serengeti, Africa, about 30% of the lions died from CDV, which came from dogs in surrounding villages.
""It has also been recognised in the Asian big cat populations,"" he added.
""Since 2000, in the Russian Far East, there have been a few cats reported as behaving strangely and coming into villages, apparently not showing much fear towards people.
""In the past few years, tissue from at least a couple of those cats have now been confirmed as showing the presence of CDV infection.
""There have not been too many cases at the moment, we think about three or four, but we think there could have been more that have gone undiagnosed.""
While some tigers appear as if they are able to build up a reasonable immunity response, most of the animals do succumb to the disease if they are exposed to the virus.
Dr Lewis explained that symptoms manifested themselves in a number of ways:
""Some will die as a result of respiratory problems, such as pneumonia for example.
""Some will have neurological problems, such as losing the fear of people or having seizures.""
But, he added: ""We do not have enough information on CDV in tigers to know what percentage go on to die; we just have a little bit of data from zoos and a little bit of data from the wild.
""There are a lot of cases of distemper in the region and tigers are partial to eating dogs.
""For a tiger to take a dog on the periphery of a village is not usual at all, so you do have the circumstances that would bring tigers into contact with CDV.""
Although it was assumed the cause of CDV infection in tigers was a result of coming into contact with dogs carrying the virus, Dr Lewis said that a research project was under way to look at the source of CDV in Amur tigers (also known as Siberian tigers) in the Russian Far East.
Worrying signs
The behaviour change in tigers was particularly worrying, Dr Lewis observed.
""This puts them at big risk because they lose their fear of poachers or they bring themselves in situations of conflict, such as playing with traffic.""
On a recent visit to the Indonesian island of Sumatra,  he said conversations with local wildlife vets seemed to indicate that CDV could already be present in the population of the critically endangered Sumatran tiger.
They told him that they had seen strange behaviour displays by tigers, such as the big cats coming into villages and losing their fear of people.
""To me, that suggests that distemper is already beginning to have an impact on tigers in Sumatra,"" he warned.
""But before you say 'yes, that is definitely the result of CDV', you need diagnostic testing of brain tissue.
""The big threats facing tigers are habitat loss and degradation and poaching, but I think the third big threat now is likely to be disease, particularly one like CDV.""
The Sumatran tiger is only found on the island and population estimates suggest that there are fewer than 700 left in the wild, of which only 40% are viable mature individuals.
Dr Lewis is returning to Sumatra in September to bring together all the vets from all the different areas that come into contact with tigers.
""The goal is to thrash out a very simple way of deciding what samples need to be taken from all tigers that are handled by humans throughout Sumatra, in order to help us with diagnostics,"" he explained.
""We also need to thrash out what samples need to be taken from domestic dog populations.
""We need to work out where we can send these samples for laboratory testing. We need to work out how we are going to store and move these samples.
""Once we have got that nailed down then we start work and try to design some sort of mitigation strategy, and that won't be easy.""","John Lewis, director of Wildlife Vets International, has expressed concern that Indonesian tigers may be at risk from Canine distemper virus (CDV).

341,"The pair were picked up by military intelligence after entering Lebanon with forged papers 10 days ago.
Baghdadi's wife - identified as an Iraqi national - is being questioned at the defence ministry.
In June, Baghdadi was named the leader of the ""caliphate"" created by IS in the parts of Syria and Iraq it controls.
Last month the group denied reports that he had been killed or injured in an air strike by US-led forces near the northern Iraqi city of Mosul.
Describing them as ""a valuable catch"", the Lebanese newspaper al-Safir said that the IS leader's wife and child had been detained in co-ordination with ""foreign intelligence services"".
They were held at a border crossing near the north-eastern town of Arsal while trying to enter Lebanon.
They were currently being held for interrogation at the defence ministry's headquarters in al-Yarza, in the hills overlooking Beirut, it added.
There were conflicting reports about the child, with a senior Lebanese security official telling Reuters news agency it was a girl - a direct contradiction of most news reports.
A DNA test is being carried out to confirm the child is Baghdadi's.
Lebanese officials initially said the woman was Syrian, but later identified her as an Iraqi called Saja al-Dulaimi, who had been living in Syria.
A woman with that name was detained by the Syrian authorities before being freed in March as part of a prisoner exchange with al-Qaeda's local affiliate, al-Nusra Front.
The exchange saw Islamic State's rival hand over a group of abducted Greek Orthodox nuns in return for the release of 150 of the Syrian government's female prisoners.
Assuming the reports are true - and there is little reason to doubt them - the Lebanese authorities now face the delicate question of what to do with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's wife and offspring.
In theory, they could prove a useful bargaining chip in the highly-charged imbroglio surrounding the fate of more than 20 Lebanese Army soldiers held hostage since August by IS and the rival al-Qaeda-linked militant group, al-Nusra Front.
The militants are demanding the release of Islamist prisoners in Lebanese jails to spare the soldiers' lives - three have already been murdered.
But al-Nusra has been much more involved than IS in back-channel negotiations for a possible exchange, so there is no guarantee it would pay off.
And there is always the possibility that the continued detention of the pair could provoke IS to seek revenge in one way or another, perhaps by seizing more hostages.
A US government source told Reuters that it was not sure how recently the woman had been with Baghdadi, and how much information, if any, she might have.
However, a Lebanese official said the arrest was a ""powerful card to apply pressure"" in the hostage negotiations with IS and al-Nusra.
Very little is known about Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who has not been seen in public since being filmed delivering a sermon at a mosque in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul in July.
A profile published by IS supporters that month said the Iraqi was married, but it is unclear how many wives he has.
Tribal sources in Iraq told Reuters he had three wives - two Iraqis and one Syrian. Under Islamic law he is allowed up to four.
The US has offered a $10m (Â£6.4m) reward for information leading to the capture or killing of Baghdadi, whose real name is Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarrai.
After rumours of his death emerged last month, IS released an audio recording purportedly of Baghdadi in which he claimed that the caliphate was expanding and called for ""volcanoes of jihad"" to erupt the world over.","The Lebanese authorities have detained Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's wife and child after they entered Lebanon with forged papers 10 days ago.

345,"Scientists have found that the animals start to breed at a later age and with longer intervals between calves than other elephant species.
The researchers say it means it could take decades for this species to recover from recent dramatic declines.
The study is published in the Journal of Applied Ecology.
Prof George Wittemyer, from Colorado State University, US, and the chair of the scientific board of Save the Elephants, said: ""I don't think any of us realised how sensitive this species was.
""The basic biology of this species is designed for a system where they grow slowly, where they increase in number slowly, and the pressure we're putting on them to harvest ivory is simply too much for them to bear.""
African forest elephants inhabit the dense tropical jungles of central Africa.  They are smaller than savannah elephants and rarer, but they have faced intense poaching.
A recent study estimated that their population declined by 65% between 2002 and 2013.
However, until now, little has been known about their demographics.
This latest study looked at more than two decades' worth of data recorded in the Dzanga forest in the Central African Republic.
Andrea Turkalo, from the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), monitored the comings and goings of more than 1,000 elephants who visited a clearing in the forest. These long-term observations enabled the team to assess the animal's reproduction rate for the first time.
""Female forest elephants in the Dzanga population typically breed for the first time after 23 years of age, a markedly late age of maturity relative to other mammals,"" she said.
""In contrast, savannah elephants typically begin breeding at the age of 12.""
The scientists also found that forest elephants produced a calf every five or six years, whereas savannah elephants gave birth every three to four years.
The researchers say the findings suggest that forests elephants could take longer to recover from poaching than was previously thought.
""Even the Dzanga elephants, which have experienced less poaching than we have seen in other sites in the forest - if they were to recover to the population size they had in 2002, it would take 90 years,"" said Prof Wittemyer.
""If we can stop poaching, they can recover a bit faster, but we are still talking about decades to get populations back to what they were in 2002.""
He added that forest elephants were facing a very real risk of extinction.
""We are talking about the loss of one of the planet's most unique, one of the largest, and probably most cognitively advanced animals on the planet. We are really facing the potential to lose this animal in the wild  - and that's because we have not been able to stop poaching.""

346,"Falkland Islander Bill Chater managed to record the scene as he returned from a day's outing to see penguins.
“We saw what we first thought was a shooting star,” Bill told me.
“It soon became obvious it was the satellite we had heard about on BBC Radio News an hour before.
“It left a long trail of smoke which was bright white in the dark sky, presumably lit by the Sun which we could no longer see.”
Goce's fall to Earth on Sunday night made it the first European Space Agency (Esa) mission to make an uncontrolled re-entry into the atmosphere in more than 25 years.
Esa has looked at the pictures acquired on East Falkland and says they represent - ""in all likelihood"" - the destructive end of its one-tonne probe.
Dubbed the ""Ferrari of space"" because of its sleek Italian design, Goce had spent the past four years making precise maps of Earth's gravity.
Its plunge through the atmosphere on Sunday became inevitable once the electric engine it had employed to stay in orbit ran out of fuel.
Tracking systems were deployed to monitor the rapid descent, with a final estimate for the location of the re-entry put close to the tip of South America, just east of Tierra Del Fuego.
American military data timed this event to have occurred at 00:16 GMT, or 21:16 local Falkland time - just as Bill, his wife Vicky, and dad, Tony Chater, were making their way home after spending the day with King Penguins.
“We were returning home from Volunteer Point,” says Bill.
“It was just getting dark following a long, spectacular sunset and as we came over Wall Mountain, heading south, we saw what we first thought was a shooting star.
“It was leaving a thick white trail of smoke and split into a couple of bits, before again breaking up into several smaller parts which all flew over our heads and disappeared northwards over Wall Mountain behind us.”
The description of the event fits, as does the location and timing. The direction of the fireballs – moving south to north – also matches what would have been Goce’s death trajectory.
Bill says he has video of the event but cannot share it because of the islands’ slow internet connection.
Goce started its descent from an operational altitude of 224km, and took a total of three weeks to fall to Earth.
The thermal and mechanical stresses that ultimately tore the satellite apart would have begun to take hold while it was still 80km from the Earth's surface.  Experts had suggested some 200-250kg could have survived all the way down. If they did, these twisted and charred materials are now at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.
It was a violent end for one of the most delicate and sensitive space instruments ever built.
Goce’s data lives on, however.
Its exquisite maps of the subtle variations in gravity across the surface of the Earth will influence a diverse array of disciplines - from ocean and climate research to geology and civil engineering.","The Falkland Islander Bill Chater recorded a shooting star-like event while returning from a day trip to see penguins.

349,"Storey netted his fourth in five games when he calmly side-footed the opener.
He then broke down the left with superb pace, earning a corner from which Vincent nodded home at the back post.
County pressed in the second half and eventually broke through when Boyce headed home what proved to be a consolation in injury time.
The absence of in-form Ryan Christie was a talking point pre-match but Storey picked up the mantle and was a key architect of this win.
County started slightly better in an attacking sense and Michael Gardyne sent a great chance over from close-range after David Raven failed to deal with Boyce's centre.
As half-time approached the visitors decisively took the initiative. Liam Polworth's accurate centre found Storey breaking beyond the defence and he didn't hesitate in stroking the ball home.
Storey then turned superbly and skinned Scott Boyd to earn a corner. The ball was flicked into the path of Vincent at the back post and he nodded it in to give John Hughes' side a commanding lead.
The second half involved a pattern of County trying new ways to break down the visiting defence, with Inverness attempting to release Storey to utilise his exceptional speed.
Stewart Murdoch drove wide and headers from Boyce and Jackson Irvine didn't overly threaten.
The afternoon got worse for Jim McIntyre when his goalkeeper Scott Fox landed awkwardly on his left leg and had to be stretchered off.
Late hope arrived when Boyce once again marked his name on the scoresheet in injury time but it proved too late to mount serious pressure on the result.
Inverness can now rightly claim they're showing similar form to that of last season. A first defeat since mid-August for County points to a good start they'll be keen to maintain.

Frontrunners in the Tower Hamlets election race, Labour's John Biggs and Independent Rabina Khan, who is supported by Lutfur Rahman, did not express support for changing the council's system of governance, but did speak of a need for more transparency in the future.
But, Mr McQueen told the debate the executive mayoral role had ""caused us so much trouble here and given us a bad image"" and ""to get rid of the role, first you have to become the role"".
He said: ""I think people now want rid of this executive mayoral role. We want the councillors to have the power back with committees.""
Tower Hamlets has had an executive mayor since 2010 when local people voted in favour of the system in a referendum.
It is one of four London boroughs to have the role along with Hackney, Newham and Lewisham.
Executive mayors have more control over budgets and services than their counterparts in the leader and cabinet systems of governance.
Supporters argue they are more accountable because they are directly elected by voters.

Police investigators calculated he was doing at least 58 mph in a 40 mph speed limit, the High Court in Edinburgh heard.
Brown, who had a previous conviction for speeding, lost control on a bend.
Detectives concluded he must have been driving too fast after experts studied tyre marks left on the road.
The court heard how a paramedic who came to the scene found the car lying on its side and ""folded around the tree.""
Prosecution lawyer Jane Farquharson said Brown, who is now aged 20, was ""good friends"" with Mr Phimister. They saw each other on a ""daily basis"".
The court heard how they spent most evenings driving around the local area.
Ms Farquharson said: ""From the marks on the road and the damage profile seen on the car, the accused Mr Brown approached the bend in the road at excessive speed.
""Whilst trying to take the shortest possible route around the inside of the bend, he lost control of his vehicle which caused the car to yaw.
""This in turn caused his car to travel off the road and strike the tree.""
As Brown was being taken to hospital for treatment, he spoke to a paramedic.
""On his way to the hospital, the accused Mr Brown spoke of the accident to a paramedic,"" Ms Farquharson said.
""In respect of his manoeuvre around the bend, he volunteered information that whilst he normally dropped down to the third gear for that corner, because he was tired he didn't and he could just remember skidding.""

Mr Martin added: ""Mr Brown appreciates that his expression of remorse will be of no comfort to the friends and family of Mr Phimister.
""It should be noted the deceased and Mr Brown were best friends.""

360,"The Carter Centre, which was set up by former President Jimmy Carter, said that represented a 83% drop from the 126 cases reported last year.
Guinea worm isn't deadly, but it is extremely painful and stops people in some of the world's poorest areas from going to work or school for months.
The former president said he wants it eradicated ""next year or sooner after"".
Guinea worm is particularly nasty.
It's carried by tiny water flies which sit in stagnant water. When people drink that water the Guinea worm larvae enters the body and starts maturing into a worm.
After about a year, when it's grown to around a meter long, it starts burrowing through the body and eventually causes a painful blister on the skin's surface.
It can then take a few days or weeks to fully emerge from the body, usually through the victim's leg or foot.
The Carter Centre has led the international effort against the disease, and the end game is very much in sight.
""This is a very exciting, challenging and sometimes frustrating experience for us,"" he said.
The former president made it his mission to wipe out the disease back in 1986.
Since then he said the number of countries reporting cases have gone from 21, to just four: Chad, Ethiopia, Mali and South Sudan.
""We hope this year we won't have any new cases, but if we do we'll just have to concentrate on those communities,"" said Mr Carter.
The former president said across those countries still affected there were actually only 20 villages and communities in the world which have cases of Guinea worm, although teams are still monitoring around 4,500 communities to ensure the disease doesn't come back.
""One person who goes into the water with a Guinea worm emerging can start the whole epidemic all over again,"" he said.
If the campaign is successful, Guinea worm will become only the second disease to ever be completely wiped out.
Smallpox was officially eradicated in 1980. Polio is also on the verge of being made extinct.
The British government has pledged another Â£4.5 million to efforts to finally end Guinea worm.
UK International Development Minister Nick Hurd said: ""Guinea worm is a truly horrendous disease.
""The fact that we are now so close to eradicating it is one of the great public health success stories of modern times.""
Mr Carter said around 88 million cases have been avoided in the last 30 years, meaning it's cost around $3 (Â£2) to prevent each case.
""Once we get rid of it, we'll never have to spend another dollar on the disease,"" he said.
One of the biggest threats to Guinea worm eradication is conflict, which stops health workers being able to go in and help affected communities.
Mr Carter said another concern is dogs becoming infected and releasing larvae into water sources, which communities can then drink from, triggering a new cluster of cases.
The 39th president of the United States said achieving the eradication of Guinea worm would be his ""most gratifying experience"".
While emerging viruses such as Zika and before that Ebola have been causing a lot of concern, this is a timely reminder that complex and frightening diseases, can be beaten. The world is not there yet, but it is extremely close.
Mr Carter is already setting his sights on the next debilitating disease he wants to wipe out.
It's another neglected tropical disease called river blindness, spread by the bites of infected flies that breed in rapidly flowing rivers and can cause people to lose their sight.
He says eradication is possible. Watch this space.","The Carter Center, led by former President Jimmy Carter, has reported an 83% drop in Guinea worm cases from last year.

Reports of a massacre at Haswiya emerged on Thursday from opposition and human rights activists, but they could not be verified immediately.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said women and children had been among 106 people killed by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad.
By Lyse DoucetChief international correspondent
Some of the dead were ""burnt inside their homes while others were killed with knives"" and other weapons, the UK-based activist group said. It added that there were reports that ""whole families were executed, one of them made up of 32 members.""
""This needs to be investigated by the United Nations,"" said Rami Abdul Rahman, director of the UK-based activist group.
However, a government official in Damascus denied reports of a massacre.
On Friday, the BBC's Lyse Doucet was able to travel to Haswiya.
When she arrived, Syrian army soldiers told her that all the bodies had already been taken away, but our correspondent found the scene of a vicious murder.
""Three charred bodies lay sprawled just inside one house. A trail of blood stained the cement,"" she reported. ""In the kitchen, where china teacups sat neatly on a shelf, more than a dozen bullet casings were scattered across a floor smeared with blood.
""In another room, two more burnt corpses were curled up next to a broken bed.""
Villagers, still visibly shocked, told the BBC that at least 100 people were killed that day.
Soldiers who escorted the team to the area said hundreds of men from a militant Islamist rebel group, the al-Nusra Front, committed the killings.
One woman told the BBC the same. But out of earshot of the official Syrian minders, another woman said the army was present at the time and that some soldiers even apologised for the murders, saying others had acted without orders.
The SOHR said all of the dead appeared to be Sunni Muslims, who make up a majority of the population and have been at the forefront of the revolt against the state during the 22-month conflict that the UN says has left more than 60,000 people dead.

But only Baltimore has seen unrest like Ferguson.
Baltimore is a thriving major city with black leadership. The thinking goes: This shouldn't be happening here.
To understand why you have to understand that Baltimore is actually two cities: One is a city mired in decline and poverty, made famous by the TV show The Wire. Another is a city on the rise with a shiny waterfront and increasing numbers of young affluent residents.
To keep the affluent Baltimore viable, city officials have pursued a laser-like focus on crime, ensuring its new up-and-coming neighbourhoods stay safe. Meanwhile, in sprawling low-income areas on the city's east and west sides, the police have been omnipresent. Sometimes their methods have bordered on draconian.
The success of the new Baltimore has never touched many parts of the city, most prominently the west side where this week's violence began. Take away the towering downtown, the waterfront and other affluent enclaves and Baltimore suddenly looks a lot like Ferguson - poor, harassed and angry.
In the 1980s and 1990s, Baltimore was haemorrhaging residents because of its high-crime rate, partly brought on by the city's massive heroin trade. David Simon, the creator of The Wire, worked then as a police reporter for The Baltimore Sun, making him an expert on the city's high-crime areas. Those experiences would later inform The Wire.
In the late 1990s, Martin O'Malley, the city's first white mayor after years of black leadership, adopted a get tough approach on crime. Mr O'Malley invested heavily in city police to turn around the fortunes of the once thriving city. He launched CitiStat, a statistics-based approach to crime fighting, sending police resources to exactly where the crime was.
His successors, Sheila Dixon and Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, both black women, maintained strong support for the police department.
For a time, the get-tough approach worked: the number of murders finally plunged below 200 in 2011.  It had been over 300 several times during the 1980s and 1990s.
When budget cuts were required, police were spared while other parts of the city like the parks and recreation department felt the axe. While other cities stressed community outreach and gentler methods, Baltimore stayed the course with tough policing techniques.
But in recent years, crime has been inching back despite more and more effort from the police department. The Baltimore Sun published a special report last year showing the city paid nearly $6m (Â£3.95m) in recent years to victims of police beatings. The Justice Department has launched an investigation into those claims.
The civic pride that courses through Baltimore's new affluent areas is absent in west Baltimore. What remains is suspicion, unemployment, poverty and frustration.
Late on Monday, on social media, young residents of the new Baltimore posted messages like ""this is not the city I fell in love with"".
And in a way they were right.
Tim Swift worked as an editor at The Baltimore Sun from 2001 to 2014. He is now a news editor for The BBC in Washington.","The recent riots and looting in Baltimore, Maryland, have brought to light the longstanding issue of police brutality and racial inequality in the city. Baltimore is a major city with black leadership, and the success of its affluent neighborhoods has been achieved through a laser-like focus on crime, with the police being omnipresent in low-income areas. However, this approach has not touched many parts of the city, particularly the west side, where this week's violence began. The get-tough approach on crime has been maintained by successive mayors, including Martin O'Malley and Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, but crime has been inching back despite more effort from the police department.

Its report claimed the cost of keeping each prisoner who is over tariff at the Category C jail amounts to more than Â£20,500 per annum.
Inspectors advised the government to implement a ""finite action plan"" to address the needs of prisoners affected which must include funding of courses to ""reduce the wait times, and increase the number of parole boards"".
The report also recommended a national database to identify prisons which deliver interventions and match prisoners to appropriate courses.

But while victims often suffer similar hardship, it said the services available for men in Northern Ireland are less extensive than for women.
One man who knows how difficult it can be to get help is Paul.
Paul, whose name has been changed to protect his identity, walked away from his 25-year marriage after suffering physical, emotional and psychological abuse.
""My wife and I had only been together two years when the trouble started,"" he told the BBC.
""She fell pregnant and made it clear that if we didn't get married and move in together I wouldn't see my child.
""She would say things to me like: 'You don't want to be one of those men who have no relationship with their children.'
""Then the kicking, slapping and shoving started, and it escalated from there until she had worn me down to believe I deserved everything I got.""
Paul's wife repeatedly attacked him and he said she would do everything she could to make him feel ""sub-human"".
He said: ""I had to keep my clothes, which were torn and dirty, in the car or the shed because I wasn't allowed to keep them in the house with her things.
""I also wasn't allowed to have the heating on, if I was the only person in the house.
""My relationship with my children was seriously affected as they were told time and again that everything was my fault, they were even left 'in charge' of me if my wife went out of the house.""
As well as the violence, which included Paul's wife trying to strangle him with an extension cord, there was financial abuse.
He said: ""Everything I had was tied up in bills - the mortgage, the electricity and the heating all came out of my wage so that I had nothing left to spend myself.""
But Paul, who is now 50, said the worst part of the abuse was being afraid to go home.
After decades of suffering in silence, he finally decided to leave, but said he had nowhere to turn.
Unaware that he was a victim of domestic violence, he had not contacted the police about his wife.
""I lived in my car for a while because I had no money of my own and couldn't access housing because I had a full-time job,"" he said.
""No one understood that my wife was still controlling me.""
Finally, Paul was able to access the services provided by the Men's Advisory Project, which receives funding from the Department of Health, after his sister heard about the organisation.
But even after Paul realised he had been a victim, he said there was little help available to him.
""There are no beds in Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland for male victims of domestic abuse,""  he said.
""The message from the police is that anybody can be a victim, but I believe that not everyone can get the help they need.""

Findhorn-based Trees for Life hopes to have created its own source of seeds by encouraging branches to flower under controlled conditions.
In trials, the charity has stimulated aspen branches to flower at its Dundreggan estate near Glenmoriston.
Trees for Life has been running experiments pollinating the trees by hand for two years.
The charity said the trees were at risk because they rarely flower, and collecting seeds from aspen in the wild for propagation is ""almost impossible"".
It said that aspens that do flower in the Highlands were often in remote or inaccessible locations, making them hard to reach for collecting seeds - if any should be available in the first place.
Unlike most trees, where male and female flowers occur on the same tree, aspens are either male or female.
Aspens flower in March and April, before the leaves appear, with both male and female trees producing catkins.
Pollinated female catkins ripen in early summer and release tiny seeds.
Under carefully controlled conditions, Trees for Life said it had successfully hand-pollinated female aspen catkins with pollen collected from male trees.
It said the catkins will ripen in a few weeks' time to produce seeds, which will be sown in the Dundreggan Tree Nursery to produce a new generation of young aspen trees.
Doug Gilbert, Dundreggan operations manager at Trees for Life, said encouraging the branches to flower in the trials was a ""major breakthrough"" for the charity.

Prison Officers Association members were ordered back to work after the government won a High Court injunction.
The Ministry of Justice said Ms Truss had now asked the POA to resume talks.
The National Offender Management Service, which is responsible for correctional services in England and Wales, said it had contacted the POA to offer a meeting with Ms Truss on Thursday.
A MoJ spokesman said the government welcomed the union's decision to end Tuesday's ""unlawful industrial action"".
""We are committed to improving safety across the prison estate and are already taking action.
""This includes tackling the use of drugs, mobile phones and drones while recruiting new staff and improving protection for staff.
""The justice secretary already met with the POA earlier this month but would not do so again until they called off their unlawful action.
""Now that prison officers are back at work she will meet the POA and invites them to resume talks with her team.""
Earlier this month, Ms Truss unveiled a White Paper detailing Â£1.3bn investment in new prisons over the next five years, including plans for 2,100 extra prison officers, drug tests for inmates on entry and exit from prisons, and more autonomy for governors.
The POA ended Tuesday's protests by saying it had achieved its aim of securing a meeting with Ms Truss.
The protests began at midnight on Tuesday and came after multiple high-profile incidents at prisons across England.

It is illegal for officers to strike, but the POA had directed its members to stop working after talks with the government over health and safety concerns broke down.

380,"Real Madrid's 2-1 defeat at Valencia earlier in the day would have allowed the Catalans to edge ahead in the title race if they had won.
But coach Luis Enrique started with Lionel Messi, Neymar and Dani Alves on the bench following the festive break.
And they were unable to inspire a fightback as Moyes secured a memorable second win as Sociedad manager.
Messi, Neymar and Alves only returned to training last Friday after an extended break in South America during the league's Christmas shutdown.
Enrique took the gamble of starting without them for a fixture that has proved tricky for Barcelona in the past.
And so it proved again with their winless run at Anoeta now extended to six games.
In Moyes's previous two home La Liga games, former Arsenal striker Carlos Vela had struck in the opening five minutes.
And while there was to be no repeat for Vela, Sociedad were still ahead after just two minutes as Alba headed a cross from Sergio Canales past his own keeper.
For a team which had already beaten Real Madrid and defending champions Atletico Madrid in San Sebastian this season, it was the perfect start.
Sociedad have been difficult to beat under Moyes, with just two losses in their previous seven matches since the former Manchester United and Everton boss took over in November, and they clung tenaciously to their lead.
They were helped by an insipid first-half performance from Barcelona, who rarely threatened an equaliser.
Sociedad went closest to a second goal when Canales turned sharply and tested former Socieded keeper Claudio Bravo at his near post.
Not surprisingly, Enrique sent on Messi at the start of the second half and waited just a further 12 minutes to introduce Neymar to try and spark an improvement.
Barcelona increasingly dominated possession and began to camp around the Sociedad penalty area.
But with a wall of blue and white shirts to pass, they could not turn their pressure into any meaningful chances.
Sociedad defended superbly with goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli making his one real save four minutes from time when dashing out to save at the feet of Luis Suarez as Moyes's side held on to move up to 13th in the table - five points above the drop zone.

382,"These were the words of the US Attorney General Loretta Lynch, as she set out how the German carmaker would be punished for attempting to hoodwink the US authorities over the emissions produced by its diesel cars.
It has been a tough week for Volkswagen.
It has been fined $4.3bn, agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges - and six executives are facing charges. One of them, Oliver Schmidt, has spent the past few days in a Miami jail. Others may yet find themselves in the firing line.
But because of this, we now have a very clear idea not only of what Volkswagen was doing wrong, and how it went about it, but also the measures that were taken to conceal that wrongdoing.
As part of its plea bargain with the US authorities Volkswagen signed up to an agreed ""Statement of Facts"". It draws heavily on the results of an investigation by the law firm Jones Day, commissioned by VW itself.
The FBI makes further detailed allegations in its criminal complaint against Oliver Schmidt. These have not yet been tested or admitted.
According to these documents, the seeds of the scandal were sown in 2006, when VW were designing a new diesel engine for the US market.
Supervisors in the engine department realised they had a problem. They could not design an engine that would meet tough emissions standards due to enter into force in 2007, and at the same time give customers the performance that they wanted.
Their solution was to ask their engineers to design engine management software which would turn on emissions controls when the car was being tested, and turn them off when it was being driven on the road.
This 'defeat device' software was able to recognise the standard testing procedure. It was based on a program developed by VW's subsidiary Audi, which engineers had specifically stated should ""absolutely not be used"" in the US.
Not everyone was happy about this, it seems. Engineers ""raised objections to the propriety of the defeat device"" in late 2006.
In response, a manager decided that production should continue, still using the device. He also ""instructed those in attendance, in sum and substance, not to get caught"".
A similar row broke out the following year, and again, the decision was taken to press on regardless.
Subsequently, the use of the defeat device appears to have become routine.
The Statement of Facts describes how the software was refined and improved over time.
A spate of breakdowns was blamed on the cars remaining in 'test' mode while being driven on the road. Supervisors worked with engineers to solve the problem, and ""encouraged the further concealment of the software"".
The engineers were also told to destroy documents relating to the issue.
The deception came to a head when, in 2014, the California Air Resources Board approached the company to find out why tests had shown that its cars were emitting up to 40 times the permissible amount of nitrogen oxides when driven on the road.
VW supervisors ""determined not to disclose to US regulators that the tested vehicle models operated with a defeat device"". Instead they ""decided to pursue a strategy of concealing the defeat deviceâ€¦ while appearing to cooperate"".
The FBI claims in its criminal complaint against Mr Schmidt - who was a head of compliance at VW's US division from 2012 to 2015 - that the deception eventually went to the very top of the company.
Citing ""co-operative witnesses"" and allegedly corroborating documentation, it claims that the company's executive management in Wolfsburg were briefed on the issue in July 2015. Rather than tell its staff to come clean about the defeat device, it says, ""VW executive management authorized its continued concealment"".
There is, however, no mention of this meeting in the statement agreed by Volkswagen.
Ultimately, Volkswagen's wrongdoing was confirmed to the authorities by a single employee acting ""in direct contravention of instructions from supervisors at VW"". But the deception did not end there.
The Statement of Facts explains how VW staff were warned by an in-house lawyer that the authorities were about to circulate a so-called ""hold notice"", obliging them to retain and preserve documents under their control.
Engineers were told to ""check their documents"", which several of those present ""understood to mean that they should delete their documents"".
The message was repeated at a number of subsequent meetings, one of them attended by 30-40 people and ultimately thousands of documents were deleted.
When the scandal at Volkswagen first came to light, the company's former US chief executive, Michael Horn blamed ""a couple of software engineers"". It is now clear that many more people were involved, at least some of them in positions of authority, and deliberate attempts were made to cover up wrongdoing.
It is not hard, then, to see why the US authorities have taken such a tough line with the company. But some questions remain unanswered.
We still don't know for certain, for example, whether people at board level knew what was going on.
It's also unclear why the same software that was fitted illegally to 600,000 US vehicles was also present on millions of others sold around the world, including eight million in Europe.
VW continues to maintain that the systems didn't actually break European law - though it is in the process of repairing those vehicles all the same.","The German carmaker, Volkswagen, has been fined $4.3bn and six executives have pleaded guilty to criminal charges for attempting to deceive US authorities over the emissions produced by its diesel cars.

Outside, after church bells rang out across the capital, thousands thronged to follow the service.
Havel, who helped lead the 1989 overthrow of communism, died aged 75.
He passed away on Sunday after a long respiratory illness, health issues that dated back to his time in prison.
By Stuart HughesBBC News, Prague
For more than two hours, thousands stood in silence on the hill overlooking Prague to pay their last respects to the dissident playwright who became a president.
In life, Vaclav Havel was associated with the artistic counter-culture. In death, he was afforded all the trappings of state.
Hradcany Square was filled with the smell of incense as the Archbishop of Prague, Dominik Duka, made the procession into St Vitus Cathedral, accompanied by priests and altar servers.
Inside, Vaclav Havel's coffin lay draped with the flag of the country he led for a decade after the ""velvet divorce"" from Slovakia in 1993. The red, white and blue colours of the Czech Republic also decorated ribbons worn by many of those gathered outside, along with black ribbons of mourning.
Many of those who gathered on this cold, damp day in Prague to watch the funeral on a large outdoor TV screen were too young to remember the days when, in 1989, Vaclav Havel rose from political prisoner to leader of his country in a matter of months. But for young and old alike, Havel is a symbol of freedom and democracy.
More than 20 years after the Velvet Revolution there are fears that the former Czech president's spirit of freedom could be threatened by a new wave of intolerance in some European countries.
But, as the funeral drew to a close and the coffin left the cathedral, the crowd broke into sustained, warm applause - sharing the sentiment voiced in Vaclav Havel's most well-known quote, that truth and love must prevail over lies and hatred.
Obituary: Vaclav Havel
Funeral in pictures
The Archbishop of Prague read out a tribute from Pope Benedict, praising Mr Havel's courageous defence of human rights and his visionary leadership in creating a new democratic system.
""Remembering how courageously Mr Havel defended human rights at a time when these were systematically denied to the people of your country, and paying tribute to his visionary leadership... I give thanks to God for the freedom that the people of the Czech Republic now enjoy,"" Pope Benedict said in his statement.
The former US Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright - who was herself born in Prague - spoke at the ceremony, along with Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg and current Czech President Vaclav Klaus.
She said Vaclav Havel had ""brought light to the places of deepest darkness"".
""He was one of the most respected men of the world, but was never satisfied that he had done everything he could have done,"" she said, adding that he would terribly missed but never forgotten.
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, were among mourners.
The presidents of France and Germany also attended, along with UK Prime Minister David Cameron, Poland's own dissident-turned-president, Lech Walesa and current leaders from across Eastern Europe.
As Havel's coffin left the gothic cathedral, through its Golden Gate and en route to the city's Strasnice crematorium for a private family funeral, the crowd broke out into a long burst of applause.
The urn with Havel's ashes is to be buried at his family's plot at Prague's Vinohrady cemetery alongside his first wife, Olga, who died in 1996.
Ahead of the ceremony, thousands of people queued to pay their respects at his coffin as it lay in state at Prague Castle.
Later on Friday, a rock concert and festival of Havel's plays is due to take at the Lucerna Palace that the family built in the early 20th Century.
Vaclav Havel first made his name as a playwright in the 1960s.
The increased freedom brought to Czechoslovakia by the Prague Spring in 1968 allowed him to satirise the communist old guard, which won him wide public acclaim.
But the Soviet invasion later that year saw his work banned and he was driven underground.
He became Czechoslovakia's most famous dissident and was jailed for ""anti-state activity"".
In 1989, when communism fell, he moved in a matter of months from being a political prisoner to president of the country.
The euphoria soon faded when Slovak nationalists succeeded in their campaign for independence during 1992.
This prompted Havel to resign from the presidency, but a few months later after the ""velvet divorce"" at the start of 1993, he was re-elected Czech president.
Although he was sometimes a reluctant leader, he continued to serve as president until 2003.","Vaclav Havel, the former president of the Czech Republic, died on Sunday at the age of 75.

Moeen and leg-spinner Adil Rashid returned combined figures of 0-284 in the first innings in Abu Dhabi, but shared seven wickets in Pakistan's second innings as England almost secured an unlikely win.
Rashid picked up five wickets on debut to become the first England leg-spinner to take a five-wicket haul since Tommy Greenhough in 1959.
""We grew up together and we are a similar age,"" said Moeen of Rashid. ""We are pretty tight, but it's about doing a job for England.
""With the one-dayers in the summer we kind of got used to it a little bit but it's nice to have another spinner, just so we can speak to each other and rub off each other a little bit.""
Rashid also earned the praise of captain Cook after bouncing back from first-innings figures of 0-163, the worst by a Test debutant.
Cook said: ""He's obviously had a tough introduction, the first day and a half not getting a wicket, bowling on probably the worst wicket you'd ever want to make your debut on as a leg-spinner when you lose the toss.
""We know that leg-spinners come into the game later on. To get his rewards like he did, and bowl like he did, really sped up the game.""
The pitch for the first Test in Abu Dhabi was widely criticised for offering minimal assistance to the bowlers.
It took until the final morning for the first two innings of the match to be completed, as Shoaib Malik and Cook ground out double centuries.
And although England almost forced an unlikely win, Mooen hopes to see more pace in the wicket in Dubai.
""It would be nice in terms of my bowling,"" he said. ""Batting would be tougher but I don't mind that and it would be good for the game and good for the people watching.""
Pakistan will have leg-spinner Yasir Shah in their side after he missed the first Test of the three-match series with a back spasm.
Shah, 29 and the fastest bowler to reach 50 Test wickets for Pakistan, is expected to replace seamer Rahat Ali.
Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq said: ""He is back and that's a good sign for us. We missed him a lot in the first Test and his return will give us that boost in the spin bowling.
""We really need to pull up our socks and the kind of fight England put in, we need to match them. I have confidence in my players that they can do that.""
Pakistan have also recalled off-spinner Bilal Asif as cover. Asif was reported for a suspect bowling action in Zimbabwe on 6 October, but can play pending a report on his action, which is expected to be completed in two weeks.
However, Pakistan are likely to be without batsman Azhar Ali, who returned home following the death of his mother-in-law and may not receive a United Arab Emirates visa in time.

Hamilton had to pass both Williams after losing the lead off the line and second place at a re-start following an early safety car.
But the Mercedes driver fought back to take the lead at the first pit stops.
Rain made for a chaotic end to the race but Hamilton came through to win from team-mate Nico Rosberg and Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel.
Felipe Massa took fourth ahead of Williams team-mate Valtteri Bottas, Red Bull's Daniil Kvyat was sixth, Force India's Nico Hulkenberg claimed seventh and the second Ferrari of Kimi Raikkonen came eighth.
The world champion's fifth win of the season  - extending his championship lead to 17 points - was greeted with roars of delight from the capacity 140,000 fans.

Hamilton admitted the Mercedes' bad starts had ""made the race for the fans"" and, as thousands streamed on to the track to salute him on the podium, he said: ""Thank you for coming out today and making my whole weekend, I really wanted to do it for you guys. I couldn't have done it without you. I'm so elated. You can't imagine how happy I am. I was tearing up on the last lap.""
Hamilton's path to victory was far from smooth, however, as Massa leapt into the lead past both Mercedes from third on the grid.
Hamilton fended off a challenge from Bottas for second on the first lap, at the end of which the safety car was deployed because of a pile-up at the first corner, involving both Lotuses and both McLarens.
Three of the four cars were taken out of the race in one go, with Lotus team-mates Romain Grosjean and Pastor Maldonado appearing to collide and McLaren's Fernando Alonso half-spinning as he took avoiding action and collecting team-mate Jenson Button, whose car also retired.
Alonso was able to continue, but needed to pit for a new front wing, although the late rain shower helped the double champion beat Sauber's Marcus Ericsson to finish 10th and score his first points of a difficult year in the uncompetitive and unreliable McLaren-Honda.
At the restart, Hamilton tried an aggressive move on Massa immediately after the safety car line, which indicates the place from which drivers can begin to race and at Silverstone is on the entry to the final Vale-Club corner complex.
But Hamilton overcooked it, ran briefly off the track, and Bottas took advantage and sneaked through into second.
Bottas was initially told he could not try to pass Massa, only for Williams to relent and allow them to race.
But the Finn could not pass the Brazilian as the two silver Mercedes tracked the two white Williams to the first pit-stop period.
Hamilton was brought in first, on lap 19, and the so-called 'undercut' worked perfectly as he produced what Williams technical chief Pat Symonds called a ""stunning"" in-lap.
Media playback is not supported on this device
A quick pit stop and a strong first lap out of the pits meant that when Massa and Rosberg pitted on the next lap Hamilton passed them before they were back out the circuit.
Rosberg came oh-so-close to beating Massa out - the two cars were side by side as they went down the pits, but Massa had the inside line for the corner where the pit lane rejoins the track and held on to second.
Even worse for Rosberg, when Bottas stopped on the next lap, the Finn rejoined ahead of the Mercedes and although Rosberg overtook him into Turn Four, Bottas got straight back in front through the kink at Turn Five.
Rosberg stayed stuck in fourth place until lap 36 of 52 when light rain began to fall.
At first, it hit only the northern part of the track at Luffield, Woodcote and Copse corners but a wobble from Bottas at Copse gave Rosberg the chance he needed and he took third, and then a couple of laps later moved into second past Massa at Turn Three.
The rain, which stopped and then returned with greater intensity over the whole of the track, was bad news for Williams, both of whose cars were passed by Vettel as the teams juggled with tyre choices in the intermittent rain at the end of the race.
It was an unexpected surprise for Ferrari at the end of one of their least competitive races of the season.

Mr Miller claims he has been ""fobbed off"" by police for many years and recently discovered some of case's evidence was destroyed in 1991.
He believes there were many ""missed opportunities"", with neighbours telling him officers did not collect formal statements from them in the 1980s, despite pledges they would.

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said there had been 2.63 million new cars made during 2015, a 6.3% rise on the year before. Production also hit a seven-year high.

James MacColl, from the Campaign for Better Transport, said bus fare increases meant it would be difficult to ""solve the problem of more cars on the road"".
""It is vital bus services are properly funded as they are a lifeline for those who rely on them to access essential services such as work, schools, health services and shops.""

The Chinese Super League's transfer window shuts next week and Mourinho was asked if the club captain would still be at Old Trafford by then.

""I would never push - or try to push - a legend of this club to another destiny,"" added the Portuguese coach.
""So you have to ask him if he sees himself staying in the club for the rest of his career or if he sees himself moving.
""It is not a question for me because I am happy to have him. I don't want him to leave.""
BBC Sport's Simon Stone
There is a clear sense now that time is ticking down on Rooney's Manchester United career.
Less than a month after Rooney eclipsed Sir Bobby Charlton to become the club's record goalscorer, manager Jose Mourinho delivered the kind of response he came out with when he was asked about the futures of Morgan Schneiderlin and Memphis Depay during the January transfer window.
Schneiderlin and Depay ended up leaving for Everton and Lyon respectively. And at 31, with 549 United appearances and 250 goals to his name, Rooney seems destined to experience the same fate.
It might not happen now. Rooney is known to be coveted by the Chinese Super League, who would offer vast sums to get the England captain to join Carlos Tevez and Oscar in the exodus east, but twice over the past few days I have been told such a move before the 28 February deadline is unlikely.
However, the end is in sight and Rooney's camp will doubtless spend the next few months exploring options.
Rooney has the carrot of knowing if he can remain in the England fold until next year's World Cup, he is likely to become his country's most-capped player, in addition to its record goalscorer.
Whether he can do that from China is doubtful, and though former team-mate David Beckham eked out the end of his England days in Major League Soccer with LA Galaxy, it is by no means certain Gareth Southgate would offer the same opportunity to a player who has plenty of competition for his number 10 role.
This is the reality that is likely to focus minds because, four years after it seemed to be happening under Sir Alex Ferguson, it now seems a question of when, not if, Rooney leaves Old Trafford for good.
Meanwhile, Rooney's team-mate Anthony Martial insists he wants to stay at the club ""for as long as possible"".
The 21-year-old has struggled to recapture the form shown during his debut season at Old Trafford and was linked with a loan move to Sevilla in December.

406,"The move follows years of briefings by the police and security sources which said that while dissidents had a high level of intent to mount attacks outside Northern Ireland, they lacked the capacity or capability to do so.
That has now changed.
The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) warned earlier this year that dissidents have shown a range of capabilities over the past 18 months which they described as deeply concerning.
These include the use of home made bombs, referred to by the police as Improvised Explosive Devices, improvised rocket launchers, close quarter shootings, and under vehicle bombs.
While the government announces updates on threat levels, the assessment is made by the security service MI5, with input from the PSNI.
This recalibration of the threat level clearly suggests they believe dissidents are actively planning to exploit their increased capabilities by exporting them to Great Britain, and that they have the capacity to do so.
No organisation was named in a written statement about the increased threat level by Home Secretary Theresa May on Wednesday, but it is understood this assessment reflects concerns about the activities of the group widely referred to as the New IRA.
It was formed in the summer of 2012, from the amalgamation of a number of dissident organisations.
The group killed prison officer Adrian Ismay using an under car bomb in March.
In a statement to the BBC at the time it warned that further attacks would follow.
Increasing the threat level from ""moderate"" to ""substantial"" means the likelihood of an attack in Great Britain has gone up from ""possible but not likely"" to ""a strong possibility"".
It does not mean MI5 has intelligence which suggests that a dissident republican attack on a target in England, Scotland or Wales is about to take place some time soon.
If that was the case, the threat level would have been raised to ""severe"", which means an attack is regarded as ""highly likely.""
The threat level dissidents pose in Northern Ireland has been characterised as ""severe"" for just over six years.
""This does not mean the balloon has suddenly gone up,"" explained a well placed security source.
""Clearly there is an increased level of concern about the capacity of dissidents to mount attacks outside Northern Ireland, but there is nothing to suggest that they are in a position to do so at this time.""
The government, MI5 and police will hope the public announcement about an increased threat level will have a deterrent effect.
Assistant Chief Constable Will Kerr, the officer who leads PSNI efforts to combat the dissident threat, said the announcement was ""about increasing awareness and encouraging vigilance.""
But the announcement also signals to dissident republicans that the security services are aware of their intentions, and will heighten their efforts to thwart them.
In addition to encouraging increased public vigilance, it is aimed at unsettling any dissident republican units planning attacks on individuals or buildings in Great Britain.
The decision to escalate the threat level in GB comes weeks after the PSNI issued a series of stark warnings about the likelihood of dissident attacks in Northern Ireland in the run up to the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising.
At the time, senior police officers said there were ""several hundred"" active dissidents, and expressed ""grave concerns"" about their intentions, capacity and capability.
Those warnings and public statements about enhanced security measures to combat the enhanced threat appeared to have a deterrent effect as dissidents were not able to mount the attacks police said they feared.","The threat level posed by dissident republicans in Northern Ireland has been increased from ""moderate"" to ""substantial,"" indicating a higher likelihood of attacks outside Northern Ireland, including in Great Britain. The decision to escalate the threat level was based on assessments by MI5 and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), which have shown that dissidents have developed new capabilities, including the use of improvised explosive devices and under-vehicle bombs. While the government and security services have not named any specific organization, it is widely understood that the New IRA is the group of concern. The increased threat level is intended to deter dissident republicans and unsettle any units planning attacks on individuals or buildings in Great Britain.</s>",mistral7b,XSUM,
407,"A US lawyer who worked with Gu Kailai several years ago told the BBC that she was attractive, charismatic and funny.
Ed Byrne, from Denver in Colorado, said he was ""shocked"" to hear that she was embroiled in a murder investigation.
But that is exactly what has happened.
Ms Gu has been ""transferred to judicial authorities"" because she is a prime suspect in the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood.
It is a case that has also led to the downfall of her husband, Bo Xilai, who until recently was one of China's most senior politicians.
Ms Gu, who is Mr Bo's second wife, studied law at the prestigious Peking University before opening her own law firm.
Mr Byrne first met her when he visited the Chinese coastal city of Dalian - where Bo Xilai was the mayor.
He went with a client and met Ms Gu to talk about a business venture.
""I was very impressed with her. She is very attractive, very charismatic and very funny.""
Later, she got in touch with him and asked him to represent several companies from Dalian that were involved in a case in Mobile, Alabama. It was 1997.
Fluent in English, Ms Gu played a major role in the lawsuit, which went in favour of the Chinese firms.
She even wrote a book about her legal battles in the United States called ""Winning a Lawsuit in the United States"".
Mr Byrne then worked with Ms Gu - whom he knew by the name of Horus Kai - on a number of other cases, meeting her in both the US and Dalian.
He also met her husband and was an ""honoured"" guest at lunches and dinners.
""People likened her and her husband to the Jack and Jackie Kennedy of China. They were the modern liberal element there.""
A source close to Mr Bo's family also described Ms Gu, who is about 52 years old, in glowing terms.
He said she closed down her law firm when her husband became the Communist Party chief in Chongqing to avoid the impression that she was benefiting from his position.
""She shut down the law firm just when it was getting very big and very exciting for her,"" said the family contact.
But he also painted a picture of a woman whose health has not been good in recent years and who hardly stepped outside the family home in Chongqing.
""She stayed at home reading books,"" he said of Ms Gu who, like her husband, is the child of a senior official.
Her father was General Gu Jingsheng, a prominent revolutionary in the years before the Chinese Communist Party took power.
He held government positions when the party took over China but, like many others, was put in prison during the Cultural Revolution, a chaotic period of political turmoil.
Ms Gu, who plays the lute, was just a young girl when it began, but she too suffered. She was forced to work in a butcher's and a textile factory.
This did not ruin her education though. She gained her degree in law and then got a masters in international politics from Peking University.
She qualified as a lawyer in 1988 and then opened the Kailai law firm in Beijing.
She met Mr Bo in 1984 while on a field trip looking into environmental art in Jin county in Liaoning province. Bo Xilai was the county's communist party secretary at the time.
The couple have one son, Bo Guagua, who went to Britain's exclusive private school Harrow, before studying at Oxford University. He is now at Harvard University in the US.
The family contact suggested that the accomplished and intelligent Ms Gu withdrew from society and business after her husband took charge in Chongqing in 2007.
But the idea that she had completely detached herself from any business seems to be false.
China's state-run news agency Xinhua said she had ""economic interests"" with Mr Heywood. It said there had been conflict over those interests that had ""intensified"".

The event's slot has been moved closer to The Open, being held from July 6-9.
It will begin three weeks of top-class links golf in Europe, being followed by the Scottish Open at Dundonald and The Open at Royal Birkdale.
""Portstewart is an excellent links course and one of Northern Ireland's hidden gems,"" said Rory McIlroy, who won this year's event at The K Club.
Tour officials had been in discussions with Portstewart and visited the course - which is regarded as having one of the most spectacular front-nine holes in Great Britain and Ireland - on the north coast of Northern Ireland.
The club is just four miles from Royal Portrush, which will host the 2019 Open Championship.
""We have no doubt the Strand Course will provide nothing less than a worthy test of golf,"" said Portstewart's general manager Michael Moss.

However doubts emerged in January that the Fermanagh course may not stage the tournament, and this was confirmed in April with Lough Erne stating the Tour had decided to change the venue to a links course.
Royal Portrush hosted the Irish Open in 2012, the first time it had been staged in Northern Ireland for 59 years.

411,"The first time he answered his phone, Xanyar Kamangar was in the passport queue at Tehran airport, the day after Iran and world powers agreed on the framework for a nuclear deal.
The second time was a couple of days later, well past midnight Tehran time, while Mr Kamangar was working on closing a deal of his own. He barely had time for a telephone interview.
The 39-year old Iranian-born banker left his well-paid job at Deutsche Bank in London late last year to co-found Griffon Capital, a corporate finance advisory and asset management firm ""betting on Iran opening up.""
""It's a generational opportunity and a chance to make a difference,"" said Mr Kamangar, a graduate of the London Business School.
""If you think Russia was big, Iran is going to be even bigger, because Iran has the [financial]  framework and regulations, but Russia was the Wild West when it opened up!""
Mr Kamangar's firm has already valued, raised and closed significant investment from mostly European firms for DigiKala, a fast-growing online retail operation, valuing it close to $150m (Â£100m).
Although modest by global comparison, this is the largest investment yet in a technology start-up in Iran.  European investors had to apply for exemptions from sanctions from their respective governments.
Sanctions by the United States and the European Union on Iran's financial, energy and trade sectors have held back the country once described as ""the biggest untapped market before Mars and the Moon"" by Martin Sorrel of advertising giant WPP.
Some anticipate a ""gold rush"" once Iran's 77-million-strong, highly educated, consumption-savvy market opens up.
When asked how quickly economic sanctions could be removed, US Secretary of State John Kerry told reporters it depended on how fast Iran could deliver its side of the bargain by limiting its nuclear activities.
Mr Kerry estimated the amount of work Iran had to do was ""in the vicinity of four months to a year"" from the date of the final deal, now aimed at 30 June.
Since the Geneva interim nuclear deal with Iran in November 2013, many European and even American conglomerates have already drawn up plans to enter the market.
They have found partners and agents and negotiated contracts. Some have even provisionally recruited staff, while others have been looking at properties to live or work in - all waiting for the ""starting gun"".
More than Iranian expats, a nuclear deal and sanctions relief could benefit those living inside the country: from cancer patients who struggled to find their prized imported medicine, to the country's aviation industry crippled by lack of spare parts.
But most of all, Iran's middle class is geared up for a resurgence.
Not all is that rosy when it comes to doing business in Iran. The economy is predominantly run by powerful entities close to the country's Supreme Leader, the security forces and the military, some of whom are hardly accountable to anyone, let alone the judiciary.
In 2004, the powerful Revolutionary Guards kicked out a Turkish airport services company from a contract for Tehran's then-new airport, citing security concerns. The Turkish company was replaced by a local consortium.
This happened under the watch of reformist President Mohammad Khatami but instigated by institutions over which his government had no control.
His successor Hassan Rouhani could find himself in the same situation.
""Did any of these stop multi-billion companies from rushing to China? Were they put off by shaky rule of law, violence or the military government in Egypt?"" asks Emanuele Ottolenghi of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a US-based think tank that advocated increased sanctions against Iran.
""No, for those companies, it is just another risk to factor in, but won't stop them from going in.""
Foreign investors flock to any forum that sheds light on the sometimes murky business mechanisms of the Iranian market.
""Rather than speculating from the sidelines about the Iran 'gold rush', we need business leaders to think like stakeholders who will constructively shape Iran's future,"" says Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, who helped organise an investment conference on Iran in London last November.
He is already planning the second Europe-Iran Forum, this time focusing on Iran's banking and financial sectors, in Geneva in September.
""Such forums allow us to encourage transparent conversations between Iranian and foreign firms on this common goal,"" says Mr Batmanghelidj.
The Iranian Ministry of Petroleum is also planning a major conference in London in September, where new oil contracts will be showcased for global energy giants.
But not all is final. The road ahead for nuclear negotiators is tough.
If putting out what is in effect a press statement could take the two sides four months of day-long talks and over-nighters, what could hammering out the details entail?
Opposition to the deal is strong, especially from Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and there is a chance it may not see the light of day on 1 July.
""I see that as a very remote possibility,"" says Mr Kamangar. ""If the deal does indeed fall through, we are a very patient bunch and believe in the unique long-term potential of the country.""","The article discusses Xanyar Kamangar, an Iranian-born banker who left his job at Deutsche Bank in London to co-found Griffon Capital, a corporate finance advisory and asset management firm focused on investing in Iran.

Smugglers' camps in the forests and plantations surrounding Padang Besar are among the main destinations of the migrants, according to a report by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
It is not yet clear what those exhumed from the graves discovered in Songkhla died from. The UNHCR report said that over half of the migrants interviewed by the UN who had travelled since October last year knew at least one person who had died in the smugglers' camps, mainly as a result of illness, beatings or being shot for trying to escape.
Police chief General Somyot Poompan told a meeting at Thailand's police headquarters in Bangkok on Friday that police will be dealt with severely if they are found to be colluding or ignoring people smuggling.
""If you are still neglecting, or involved with, or supporting or benefiting from human trafficking networks - your heads will roll,"" he said.

416,"Love him or loathe him, Rob Ford is not your typical politician.
While allegations of crack-smoking might see most politicians ducking for cover, the mayor of Toronto instead admitted taking the drug in a ""drunken stupor"" and called on local police to distribute the footage.
""Yes, I have smoked crack cocaine,"" Mr Ford said outside his office.
""I want everyone in the city to see this tape,"" he told reporters at city hall. ""I don't even recall there being a tape or video. I want to see the state that I was in.""
The video's existence was first revealed by the gossip website Gawker and the Toronto Star newspaper in May, followed by a steady stream of damaging stories about the mayor's drunken behaviour and lies.
He had denied taking crack cocaine and even claimed the video did not exist.
But after Toronto police announced last week that it was in their possession, Mr Ford's approval rating actually climbed five points to a healthy 44%.
Which begs the question, how does he do it?
Marci McDonald, a journalist with the magazine Toronto Life, puts it down to the unswerving loyalty of the so-called Ford Nation.
On an investigation into an aide: ""It's actually no-one's business what happens in my office.""
On his Toronto neighbourhood: ""This is an insult to my constituents to even think about having a homeless shelter in their ward.""
On cyclists: ""My heart bleeds for them when someone gets killed. But it's their own fault at the end of the day.""
On public health: ""If you are not doing needles and you are not gay, you wouldn't get Aids probably, that's the bottom line.""
On his visit to western Canada: ""I'm telling you, you can insult their wives, but don't insult their football teams. It was an amazing experience.""
The concept, she says, comes from the sports world, ""the idea of a groundswell of hardworking, beer-drinking people rallying around an ordinary guy"".
The ""ordinary guy"" she refers to appeared in public after the crack-smoking allegations resurfaced, trick-or-treating with his kids in a Toronto Maple Leafs ice hockey team jersey.
This is the same man who, having abandoned his pledge to lose weight as part of a diet campaign, slipped off the scales and twisted his ankle during a public weigh-in.
Earlier this year, while attempting to evade reporters at city hall, he walked face first into a camera, shouting expletives while nursing his eye.
""You watch this guy with wonder. He's the antithesis of the image-savvy, controlled politician,"" says Ms McDonald. ""No journalist wants to miss one of his unscripted appearances.""
Mr Ford's popularity was borne out of a conflict between the suburbs and downtown Toronto.
Lorne Bozinoff, chief executive of Forum Research, which conducted last week's popularity poll, says the amalgamation of the city in the late 1990s created tensions.
Mr Ford gave a voice to car-driving, conservative suburbanites, who felt neglected by downtown politicians. His ""everyman"" campaign for low taxes and smaller government won massive support in the suburbs.
""In the last few days, downtown politicians have been saying he should resign,"" says Mr Bozinoff. ""The Ford Nation say that's not fair, that he hasn't even been charged, that he hasn't been convicted, which is true.""
Still, it seems strange that a politician known for behaviour befitting a teenage delinquent should enjoy such strong support in the conservative suburbs.
Mr Bozinoff believes that people are willing to shrug off the mayor's ""black sheep status"".
""He's a common-touch politician,"" he says. ""He returns his own phone calls.
""Whatever problem you have, he'll come out to your house and deal with it. He doesn't have a limo. He drives his own car.
""He's just a very familiar person.""
Joe Warmington is a columnist with the Toronto Sun, a right-leaning tabloid widely read by the mayor's core supporters. He spotted Mr Ford early in his political career, about a dozen years ago.
""Rob Ford has always been grassroots,"" says Warmington. ""I was the guy who told him, just be you, the everyman, the guy who's going to fight for the taxpayers.""
Despite receiving a volley of abuse from Mr Ford after making reference in a recent column to his drunken exploits and alleged fondling of a mayoral candidate, Warmington continues to support him.
""Just because he yelled at me, I'm not going to turn on him,"" he says.
Joe Mihevc, a left-leaning councillor at city hall, points out that Mr Ford, the son of a successful businessman who grew up in a wealthy home, is not the ""everyman"" he claims to be.
""We're in an era where people just want to stick it to the man. People forget he's a rich man who grew up with a silver spoon in his mouth. They think he's the guy who sticks it to the system,"" he says.
Mr Mihevc believes that Mr Ford has developed a rather disingenuous ""outsider"" narrative, pitching himself as a victim of ""the elitist downtown latte-sipping media and socialist hordes"".
But, looking at Mr Ford's background, neither would he appear to be an ""insider"". His family members have been embroiled in a tangled web of violent incidents over the years.
In 2005, his sister Kathy was shot in the face during an altercation between two men at her parents' home. Last year, one of those men, a convicted drug dealer, threatened to murder the mayor.
As Mr Ford once told the Toronto Star: ""Our family has been through everything - from murder to drugs to being successful in businessâ€¦ Nobody can tell me a story that can shock.""
Not much is known about Mr Ford's private life. Marci McDonald, who spent months trying to gain access to his inner circle, found it impossible to get so much as a glimpse of his ""invisible wife"".
Over the years, the only signs of Renata Ford's existence have been a couple of 911 calls, one of which was made on Christmas morning 2011, to alert police that a drunk Mr Ford was planning to take the children to Florida against her wishes.
If the Toronto mayor's past seems to be a catalogue of unbelievable incidents, his future looks set to continue in the same vein.
Toronto-based communications specialist Scott Reid says that the mayor seems to be engaged in a juggling act right now - apologising for getting ""hammered"" and ""a little out of control"" at recent public events - allegations he had previously denied - while side-stepping the crack allegations.
On Monday, he was on fighting form, daring doubting colleagues to quit. ""I'll be running the ship even if it is by myself,"" he told a talk radio station.
""But, the truth is bearing down on him like a locomotive,"" says Mr Reid.
""I think there's a willingness to suspend disbelief and to be tolerant but it has its limits. His cartoonish handling of the situation has separated him from reasonable supporters.""
The police have not pressed charges against Mr Ford. His associate and driver Alexander Lisi is accused of threatening two gang members who had been trying to sell the video. Police reports detail repeated meetings between Mr Ford and Mr Lisi this year.
The decision on whether the video is made public will be made by the courts.
Mr Mihevc's descriptions of Mr Ford suggest a troubled character.
""I sat beside him for 10 years and he's as quiet as can be,"" said Mr Mihevc. ""He's a brooder. However when he talks football, he actually smiles.
""But, he's not a happy guy.""","The article discusses the popularity of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, despite his admission of smoking crack cocaine and other controversial behavior. The author attributes his popularity to the unwavering loyalty of his supporters, known as ""Ford Nation,"" and his relatability as an ""ordinary guy."" The article also explores the tensions between Ford and downtown Toronto politicians and the role of the media in shaping public opinion.</s>",mistral7b,XSUM,

Fans entered the pitch at Hampden Park after Hibs won their first Scottish Cup in 114 years.
Thousands of Hibs fans jumped the barriers at the final whistle and a number of Rangers fans also came on to the pitch.
The pitch invasion delayed the presentation of the trophy and there was no lap of honour by Hibs players.

It includes live performances of Love Is A Losing Game and Wake Up Alone which were never broadcast.
The release precedes a documentary film about the star's life.
Entitled Amy it is directed by Asif Kapadia, whose last movie was an acclaimed biopic of Ayrton Senna.
Kapadia conducted more than 100 interviews with 80 people - including friends, family and colleagues of the star, although her father, Mitch Winehouse, has since distanced himself from the film.
BBC Music's companion programme focuses exclusively on interviews and sessions by the London-born star.
She is seen discussing her musical influences, her aspirations and the intensely personal nature of her lyrics.
""I've been through times where I've been so [messed] up that I've had to just write everything down - even feelings I don't want to acknowledge.
""It's good, because someone else might hear that and be like 'I'm not an idiot for feeling them things.'""
She also talks about her tempestuous relationship with Blake Fielder-Civil, which inspired much of the Grammy Award-winning album Back To Black.
""I fell bang in love with someone and it didn't do me any favours,"" she says. ""When I split up with this fella, I didn't have anything to go back to. I wasn't working, so I was playing pool for four hours every day, getting drunk, having to be carried home in a wheelbarrow. So Back To Black is about a black mood, I guess.""
The quotes, many of which are also being seen for the first time, are drawn from interviews Winehouse gave to the BBC for documentary projects including the Jazz and Soul Britannia series on BBC Four.
Performances have been drawn from The BBC One Sessions (2007), Glastonbury (2004 and 2008), The Mercury Music Prize (2004), Later... with Jools Holland (2006) and The Hootenanny (2006).
Winehouse died at her London home in 2011 at the age of 27.

""Jane Austen was my first experience of grown-up literature,"" said Baker.
""But as I read and re-read her books, I began to become aware that if I'd been living at the time, I wouldn't have got to go to the ball; I would have been stuck at home with the sewing.""
The 39-year-old British author said she drew her inspiration from her family's years in service.
""Aware of that English class thing, Pride and Prejudice begins to read a little differently,"" she explained.
Longbourn follows a romance between a newly arrived footman and a housemaid in the Bennet household that runs parallel to the love story between Mr Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet.
""I sent it out last week,"" said Clare Alexander, Baker's agent. ""[US publisher] Knopf bought it Monday. On Wednesday, it was bought by Doubleday in the UK.
""By Thursday the film rights had gone. By Friday, we had signed up two foreign translations.""
""Longbourn is a piece of art that emerges from a much-loved classic,"" said Alexander of Baker's fifth novel.
""It is immensely satisfying to have worked with a talented writer from the outset and to see her take flight. Longbourn will make her a literary star.""
Translation rights have been sold in Spain, Italy, Norway, Denmark, Germany, Brazil, France and Sweden, according to the book's UK publisher Transworld.
Film rights have been bought by Random House Studio and Focus Features, which distributed the 2005 film version of Pride and Prejudice in the US.

The WTO, which represents 162 countries, called it ""the most significant outcome on agriculture"" since the body's foundation in 1995.
But longstanding talks on other trade barriers were left unresolved at the end of the summit in Kenya.
Removing agriculture export subsidies is intended to help farmers in poorer countries to compete more fairly.
""The decision you have taken today on export competition is truly extraordinary,"" WTO chief Roberto Azevedo said at the closing session in Kenyan capital, Nairobi.
The summit of ministers, which finished on Saturday after five days of talks, was the first to be held in Africa.
The WTO called the farming agreement ""historic"", while the European Commission said it would be ""good for fairer trade"".
""For those who had doubts, it proves the relevance of the WTO and its capacity to deliver results,"" EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said.
Kenya's Foreign Minister Amina Mohamed said the summit would be ""remembered as having made that leap"" from a time when the WTO was divided along a ""developed and developing divide"".
It follows a WTO deal in July to cut tariffs on $1.3trn (Â£833bn) worth of technology products.
But the body had been under pressure in Nairobi to remove other trade barriers after discussions had stalled in recent years.
The lack of progress in the ongoing Doha Round of talks, which first started in the Qatari capital in 2001, had led some countries to seek agreements among smaller groups.
Doha's goals included increased duty-free access for developing countries; lower tariffs on agricultural products, textiles and clothing; and the reduction of trade-distorting subsidies from developed countries.

426,"Full-back Niamh Briggs is the captain of the Ireland rugby union team. This year Ireland will host the World Cup and in this special column - written for Women's Sport Week 2017 - Niamh explains the challenges of preparing for the tournament as an amateur team, striking the right balance between work and sport and the importance of victory to the growth of the game.
I can think back to many proud moments during my career - winning my first Ireland cap, the Grand Slam in 2013, beating New Zealand, my 50th cap, and beating Scotland on the final day of the Six Nations in 2015 to lift the trophy - but winning the World Cup would top it all.
With Ireland hosting the tournament, we want to show what we are made of - and we won't be settling for the semi-finals again, like we did in 2014.
I balance rugby with my full-time job for An Garda Síochána (the police force in Ireland).
Being a Garda was always something I wanted to do. I did not want to sit in an office all day; I wanted a job where I would be active and meet people.
In many ways, the qualities that attracted me to the Gardaí are similar to the things I appreciate most about playing sports.
And the job marries with sport very well - both rugby and the Gardaí have been great for me and I'm fortunate to have incredibly supportive and understanding bosses.
I'm able to train in the mornings for a few hours before work - and as someone who often over-thinks things, I find work helps distract from rugby. Likewise sport and training take my mind off work.
Finding the balance between training, games, and work can be tough and to manage you have to be willing to accept that you'll have little time for anything else.
I make personal sacrifices but I do it because I love it. Knowing that it cannot last forever is the hugely motivating factor.
As an amateur side, the Ireland team is made up of players with a diverse range of jobs.
We have students, teachers and lecturers. Some work for the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU), while Claire Molloy is a doctor. This can make training tough.
We have week-long training camps a couple of times over the summer but outside of that train in regional centres.
I'm based in Limerick, so train at the University of Limerick (UL), where the Munster lads train, with a couple of other girls from the team, but we have regional centres in Cork, Galway, Belfast and Dublin. The majority of players can make it to one of those.
Unfortunately, a couple of the girls have to train on their own. Molloy, for example, lives and trains alone in Wales.
Finding the strength to train alone like that is phenomenal. It's extremely difficult to get the best out of yourself in sessions and sometimes, after work when you are tired, you are reliant on the ability of the people around you to push you through.
I have always been incredibly sporty. I was quite a shy child growing up, and lacked in self-esteem, but sport gave me the opportunity to have another, more confident, persona.
My dad's job meant we moved around a bit. When I started a new school or was thrust into in a new area, sport was the way I settled in. It was a common language.
I'm now 32 but I didn't actually start playing rugby until I was 21. I was playing Gaelic football at a fairly high level when I was asked to take part in a tag tournament at my local rugby club. I won the player of the tournament prize.
In my small town - Dungarvan, in Waterford - women's sports teams would struggle for numbers. So when asked to join, I said: ""I'll come and play rugby if you come and play Gaelic football."" That's what teams had to do to survive at that stage.
Women's rugby itself in Ireland is still in its infancy. Professionalism isn't yet an option. There is still a lot of work to do building the domestic game's foundations before a professional women's league is sustainable.
The women's game only came under the umbrella of the IRFU in 2008 - and there are still big barriers that we have to overcome.
Some clubs still don't have girls' teams. We need to make every club accessible - that's really important. Once they're in, it's all about trying to keep them.
Often we only have a couple of teams that are, say, under-15 or under-18 in close proximity to each other so they might not be able to play that many competitive games.
It's vital that we keep working to generate those pathways into the game for girls.
There's an onus on us all as women rugby players. We speak about it as a national team. You go out, you play, and you leave the jersey in a better place for the next person who puts it on - and that filters down to club and provincial level.
I don't like to use the term the term 'role model' but that's what we get called, and is how we have to act.
England and France provide excellent models for where women's rugby can go. They have huge numbers participating and that needs to be our ultimate aim.
A big part of growing the game comes as a consequence of our success as a team. We have reaped big benefits from our success in the Six Nations in recent years and reaching the semi-finals of the last World Cup.
Our 2014 victory over the All Blacks - who had not lost in the World Cup since 1991 - felt incredible. And if we can put in a good shift at this summer's World Cup on home soil and get the country behind the sport in the same way our New Zealand win did, that can only be good for the game. We have to take the opportunity to build a strong legacy.
The prospect of captaining Ireland at a World Cup on home soil is very exciting. It would be a hugely proud moment for me and my family - but I have to get picked first!
I have been very fortunate to have a good bunch of senior girls in the team who are able to take on leadership roles when needed and we very much work together at it.
I learned a lot from Fiona Coghlan, and watched Brian Driscoll and Paul O'Connell, but ultimately it's about being comfortable in the role.
I've missed a lot of rugby this year. That takes its toll mentally. You will always worry about your place in a World Cup year but the support from staff and the team has been great. I have just been concentrating on getting myself back in, getting fit again, showing what I can do in training, and putting my hand up for selection.
I wouldn't like to be coach Tom Tierney having to select a squad of 28 for this World Cup. There are 48 training in the extended squad working really hard.
This breeds a lot of competition and that's what you want. If we are to do well, we need really good players who can stand up to the test of international competitions.
To be involved in a cross-border tournament in Ireland is a proud achievement for us.
Sport is powerful enough to make political divisions fade into the background, to the extent that being part of an all-Ireland team doesn't even figure in our consciousnesses as players.
We all want to play in games where the stakes are high and we want to play with the best.
The World Cup won't be a walk in the park. We have a tough group with France, Australia and Japan.
France beat us to third place last time round, Australia have some very strong sevens players coming back into their team, and Japan are putting huge resources into the sport before hosting the next men's World Cup.
In Ireland, there's been a huge shift towards women's sport generally and particularly women's rugby. The more our games are televised - and the more that people can see we're good athletes and good rugby players - the bigger that shift will be.
We want to win the World Cup and we're preparing to win it.

Asia are expected to get eight to nine places, compared to 4.5 now, and South America, which has 10 member countries, a total of six, also up from 4.5.
The Concacaf region, made up of the Caribbean, Central and North American countries, would get 6.5 places, compared to 3.5, with Oceania, the small Pacific Islands confederation, having one automatic place at the finals instead of 0.5.
Inter-continental playoffs between countries with half a place would determine the additional spots at the finals.
The final allocation of places must be passed by the Fifa Council.
The subject of the expanded World Cup featured prominently at a three-day summit between Fifa chief Gianni Infantino and more than 50 presidents of the African FAs.
The talks were behind closed doors but Fifa officials said Infantino had outlined plans for an expanded World Cup and new development assistance for member countries.
It is the first time a summit of this type has been held, giving Africa's FA representatives informal contact with the Fifa leadership, including the world governing body's recently appointed general secretary Fatma Samba Diouf Samoura.
""It has been a very good idea and a chance for the associations to also speak directly to the Fifa leadership about their issues and concerns,"" said Ahmad, the president of the Madagascar Football Federation.
Ahmad, who uses just one name, is running for the presidency of the Confederation of African Football against long-standing incumbent Issa Hayatou of Cameroon next month.
The summit comes three weeks before the Caf elections in Addis Ababa on March 16 and the FIFA event in Johannesburg has been dominated by intense lobbying, delegates said.
""Most of the business at this summit is actually outside of the conference room, in the corridors and the hotel lobby as different candidates try to persuade associations to vote for them,"" said one African FA chief, who asked not to be named.","The document discusses the request made by the continent's football association presidents to Fifa for an increase in the number of spots in the 48-team World Cup.

435,"Looking for the earliest signs of Alzheimer's disease, they analysed levels of 1,129 proteins circulating in the blood of more than 200 twins.
These were compared with data from cognitive-function tests over the next decade, in Translational Psychiatry.
And levels of one protein, MAPKAPK5, tended to be lower in those people whose brains declined.
MAPKAPK5 is involved in relaying chemical messages within the body, although its connection with cognitive decline is unclear.
Dementia cases are expected to treble globally by 2050, but there is no cure or treatment.
It can take more than a decade from the first changes in the brain to culminate in symptoms such as memory loss, confusion and personality change.
And drug companies believe they need to treat patients years before symptoms appear in order to protect the brain.
Dr Steven Kiddle, a Medical Research Council scientist at King's College London, told the BBC News website: ""People think it may be hard to reverse 20 years of potential damage to your brain.
""But if you could start much earlier in that process, then you might be able to find something that works.""
He said a blood test could help identify people for clinical trials.
But he added: ""A test you could go in to your doctor to say, 'Do I have Alzheimer's disease or not?' I think that's a long way off.""
The twins in the study will have to be followed for many more years to see whether levels of the protein predict dementia.
Dr Eric Karran, from the charity Alzheimer's Research UK, said: ""This study associated blood levels of a protein called MAPKAPK5 with cognitive decline over a 10-year period, but it will be necessary to investigate more about a possible mechanism linking this protein to changes in memory and thinking.

For now, the line stretches for 472km (293 miles). But there is a 25-year masterplan for it to link land-locked South Sudan, Rwanda, Burundi, Ethiopia and eastern DR Congo to the Indian Ocean.

439,"He tweeted hours after Donald Trump Jr spoke to Fox News about the meeting he was told would offer Kremlin-linked information about Hillary Clinton.
Critics accuse Mr Trump Jr of intent to collude with the Russians, and believe he may have broken federal laws.
Mr Trump Jr told Fox News the meeting was ""such a nothing"".
However, he accepted he should have handled it differently.
Earlier on Tuesday Mr Trump Jr released the email exchange that brought about the meeting, after being informed the New York Times was about to publish it.
US officials are investigating alleged Russian meddling in the US election.
Since he was elected, President Trump has been dogged by allegations that Russia tried to sabotage Mrs Clinton's campaign.
He has denied any knowledge of this and Russia has also repeatedly denied interfering.
Mr Trump Jr received an email from an intermediary, British music publicist Rob Goldstone, promising documents from Russia that would incriminate Mrs Clinton.
At that time, his father was the presumptive Republican nominee and heading towards an election fight against his Democratic rival.
The meeting was reportedly arranged by Russian businessman Aras Agalarov and his son Emin, a pop star who was managed for a time by Mr Goldstone.
One email from Mr Goldstone said the information they had been promised was ""obviously very high-level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr Trump"".
Mr Trump Jr's response to it was: ""If it's what you say I love it.""
Mr Trump Jr, his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and then campaign chairman Paul Manafort met Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower in New York in June 2016.
It became apparent, Mr Trump Jr later said, that Ms Veselnitskaya wanted to discuss a suspended programme for Americans to adopt Russian children.
Donald Trump Jr told Fox News' Sean Hannity that he did not tell his father about last year's meeting: ""It was such a nothing. There was nothing to tell.
""I mean, I wouldn't have even remembered it until you started scouring through this stuff. It was literally just a wasted 20 minutes, which was a shame.""
In retrospect, he would have done things a little differently, Mr Trump Jr told Fox News, but he defended his actions.
""This is before the Russia mania, this is before they were building this up in the press. For me this was opposition research, they had something you know maybe concrete evidence to all the stories I'd been hearing about.""
But the meeting went nowhere, he said, and it was apparent Mrs Clinton was not the subject.
He could not vouch for the information he was sent, he said.
""Someone sent me an email. I can't help what someone sends me.  I read it, I responded accordingly, and if there was something interesting there, I think that's pretty common.""
Just hours after Mr Trump Jr set up the meeting with Ms Veselnitskaya, his father promised to give a ""major speech"" about Mrs Clinton.
In a speech on Tuesday 7 June 2016 - the same day Mr Trump Jr arranged by email to meet the Russian lawyer - his father said he would discuss ""all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons"" a week later.
""I think you're going to find it very informative and very, very interesting,"" the then-Republican candidate added. He did not follow up on the promise.
A day before the 9 June meeting, the website DCLeaks, which US intelligence officials say Russians used in their election interference, began publishing documents related to Clinton donors.
A week later, DCLeaks released internal Clinton campaign documents.
In July 2016 the anti-secrecy website Wikileaks published thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.
President Trump has defended his son twice now in tweets. His most recent says Donald Trump Jr did a ""good job"" on Fox News and called it ""the great Witch Hunt in political history. Sad!""
On Tuesday, he described his son as a ""high quality person"", something that spawned a number of memes on social media.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied any link to the Russian lawyer, and Ms Veselnitskaya herself has said she was never in possession of information that could have damaged Mrs Clinton.
Mr Goldstone has also denied any knowledge of involvement in the election by the Russian government.
Legal experts say that Mr Trump Jr could fall foul of campaign finance laws, which prohibit accepting anything of value from a foreign government or foreign national.
His apparently enthusiastic response to the offer of information about Mrs Clinton could also breach conspiracy laws.
But journalist and USA Today contributor Michael Wolff told the BBC's Newsnight on Tuesday that that there was no evidence of criminal activity.
""There's no crime that we know of yet,"" he said. ""But we certainly are a big step forward to the circumstance in which there could be collusion in the commission of a crime. And that's important because just to establish collusion, as the Trump people are desperately saying today, is not a crime.""
The idea that Mr Trump Jr could fall foul of electoral law was also downplayed by Mr Wolff.
""I think that's a kind of a sideshow at this point. One of the other aspects... is the media response to this which is a paroxysm of glee and delight and I-told-you-so and game over.""
Few Republicans have yet responded to the latest developments, although one Trump loyalist, Lee Zeldin, tweeted that though he wanted the president to succeed ""that meeting... is a big no-no"".
The highest-ranked Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, called the revelations a ""very serious development"" and said he wanted everyone involved in it to testify to the panel.

No serious injuries were reported as thousands of people fled the flames.
There were concerns on Tuesday for the safety of some 90 unaccompanied children at the camp. Greek media said they had been moved to another facility and would then be taken to Athens.
Overcrowding at the Moria camp has fuelled tensions among residents too and police reinforcements have been sent to boost security.
Northern Aegean regional governor Christiana Kalogirou spoke of an ""unmanageable situation"" and accused the EU of failing to honour its commitments.
Through the barbed wire fence, the signs are there: tips of blackened trees and patches of scorched earth where a fire engulfed large parts of Moria, the biggest migrant camp on the island of Lesbos.
For months, anger has been building in Moria as asylum applications have been delayed and migrants have been held in an overcrowded camp. Moria has capacity for 3,500 - but around 5,000 live here in stretched facilities.
""Fighting broke out between blacks and Afghans"", says Kingsley, a Ghanaian man who we spoke to through the fence, the authorities not allowing us in.
In the wider Lesbos community, there's also growing anger over the continued migrant presence. The neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party has stoked it, organising protests and exploiting the tension. It could prompt more flare-ups here.

The number of migrants and refugees arriving on the Aegean islands has slowed since the EU reached a deal with Turkey, but some 13,500 are still being sheltered there.
In March, the EU agreed to work towards visa-free travel for Turkish citizens to Europe's Schengen zone in exchange for Ankara's assistance in curbing migrants crossing to the islands.
What led to the fire late on Monday remains unclear.
According to Greek news agency ANA, a brawl started on Monday after a rumour that refugees would be deported to Turkey en masse. Other witnesses said the disturbance began in an argument over food.
Humanitarian worker Fotini Rantsiou said riots were not unusual in Moria and tensions in the camp had been high all day.
She said a man waiting for news of his asylum application became frustrated with the process and shouted ""freedom"", provoking alarm among 2,000 people in the camp and a later hunger protest.
There were fears that the ultra-nationalist Golden Dawn was trying to advantage of the unrest on Lesbos.

Key to his election victory was the promise to revitalise Egypt's moribund economy.  The Qataris positioned themselves to prime the pump with massive transfers of cash, some $10 billion (Â£6.5bn) since Mr Morsi came to power.
But this was not a  charitable giveaway. It was in the nature of an investment.  A Qatari economist told the BBC: ""We couldn't stand by and let Egypt collapse"", but the billions came with an expectation - ""I'll give you the money, show me the outcome,"" he said.
The Qataris had already secured a lucrative deal to sell their gas to the Egyptians and they were  proposing to heavily invest in the redevelopment of the Suez Canal.
The thinking was that with a functioning economy and a grateful nation, Qatar would be in pole position to capitalise on a resurgent Egypt.
But as Mr Morsi stumbled from one failure to another, the promised economic recovery never got off the ground.
On Wednesday that cost Mr Morsi his job and left the Qataris busy attempting damage control.  Al Jazeera, based in the Qatari capital, Doha, and funded heavily by the royal family, carried a statement from what it called a foreign ministry  source that said in part ""Qatar will remain a supporter of brotherly Egypt"".
And the new Emir Tamim sent best wishes to the interim Egyptian President Adly Mansour.
Michael Stephens, a Gulf analyst with Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) Doha agrees that damage limitation is the order of the day for Qatar.
""The Qataris got into bed with one side and now that side is out,"" he said.
Mr Stephens said that a senior Qatari businessman had told him ""it's like we've dumped our girlfriend"", but Mr Stephens said it is not quite as simple as that.
""The Muslim Brotherhood is out for now but in a fair and free election they could be voted back in.""
Even so, Sheikh Tamim and his advisors will be scrambling to establish a new position on Egypt, one that for the time being at least extricates them from their close relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood while striving to protect the billions they have already invested.
And his task is made all the more difficult with the departure of the long-serving Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hamad bin Jassim al Thani.
He was seen as the architect of an assertive Middle East foreign policy that saw Qatar backing Islamist rebels in  Libya and securing American agreement to arm Syrian rebels, Islamist and non-Islamist alike (though the suspicion was that the Qataris were directing weapons to hardcore Islamist factions like the al-Nusra front rather than to secular rebels).
And of course the unwavering support - until the events of Wednesday - for Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood.
The prime minister left his twin posts at the same time that Sheikh Tamim took over.  HBJ as he is known has been replaced as foreign minister by Khalid al-Atiyya.
Mr Atiyya will need all of his reputedly formidable intellect in assisting the new Emir to devise a foreign policy shorn of an Islamist agenda.
It was the aggressive pursuit of that agenda that annoyed Qatar's Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) allies, neighbouring Saudi Arabia being the most important of those, but certainly the United Arab Emirates, which is in the midst of a harsh crackdown on a Muslim Brotherhood associated religious society al-Islah, may be forgiven for a bit of a gloat at the expense of the Qataris.
And both those countries will be looking to advance their position in Egypt at Qatar's expense.","The Qatari support for Islamists in the Middle East as a strategy to establish itself as a regional powerbroker is increasingly threadbare. In Syria, President Bashar al-Assad is gaining the upper hand on rebel forces that have had substantial backing from Qatar. In Egypt, the young Emir may be left holding onto a policy that has cost the Qataris billions while backing the Morsi government. The strategy of support for Mr Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood looked a shrewd one just a year ago, but with the promised economic recovery never getting off the ground, Mr Morsi was ousted, leaving the Qataris busy attempting damage control.</s>",mistral7b,XSUM,
446,"Across the UK the number of calls to the charity about forced marriage has risen from 55 calls a year in 2011 to 141 in 2013.
Around a quarter of those who contacted ChildLine about the issue were aged 12 to 15, the NSPCC said.
From Monday, forced marriage will be a criminal offence in England and Wales.
The Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill will make the crime of forced marriage punishable by a maximum of seven years in prison.
The NSPCC, which has released an animated film to educate children about it to mark the change in law, said some of those who called ChildLine last year were frightened, depressed or even suicidal.
The charity says others had been threatened by their families and that one in 10 cases had involved violence.
Sameem Ali told BBC Breakfast she was forced into a marriage after she was taken abroad at the age of 12 by her mother.
""I was brought back to the UK at the age of 13 - I was pregnant at the time. I gave birth at the age of 14 in the UK.
""Nobody batted an eyelid, nobody asked any questions because it was culturally acceptable,"" she said.
John Cameron, from the NSPCC, said it was difficult to pinpoint the number of children who might be at risk of forced marriage, but said the charity had seen a ""real increase"" in the number of calls it has received on the issue.
""Children are becoming more and more conscious of the fact that they want to have an opportunity to choose their partners and have relationships out of choice and not be forced into it,"" he told the BBC.
He said children are now being ""empowered to speak out"" but said more work needs to be done.
Dr Ash Chand, the NSPCC's strategy head for minority ethnic children, said the change in the law was a ""huge step forward"".
""However, there is still much work to be done. Choosing a life partner is a basic human right and no religion or culture condones forced marriage.
""Yet, despite this, many children and young people are being coerced or even forced to do so without their consent.""
BBC Asian Network reporter, Poonam Taneja, said forced marriage remains a ""very under reported problem"" and said the ChildLine figures may just be the ""tip of the iceberg"".
Last year the government's forced marriage unit gave advice or support to potential victims of a possible forced marriage in 1,302 cases.","The number of calls to a UK charity about forced marriage has risen from 55 a year in 2011 to 141 in 2013.

447,"It is not as if more teams are doing it than before, but it is being highlighted because the likes of West Ham, Leicester and Crystal Palace have had notable successes playing that way.
What I think has changed is that more managers understand the need for pace.
That has always been important, of course, but I've noticed a difference in recruitment recently in that a lot of our top-flight clubs now see it as the top priority when they look for signings.
Most teams play a way that suits their players, and if lesser clubs now have more players with speed who can get up the other end of the pitch quickly then that alone gives them a great chance to excel on the counter attack, so no wonder they are doing it.
Counter attacking is often associated with the away team or the underdog because your obvious tactic in that situation is to protect what you have got.
That is in contrast to the philosophy of playing at home, where the expectancy of your fans creates a need for your team to attack and press high up the pitch. At the bigger clubs, their supporters expect their team to dominate possession too.
So playing on the counter attack is often forced on the away team. I can also remember it just happening subconsciously, rather than as a deliberate tactic.
Whatever the circumstances, in my 15 years playing in the Premier League, the lesser clubs would generally always set up to play that way when they went away from home, especially to a bigger team.
When I was at Fulham, for example, very rarely would we go to a big team and go hell for leather and try to match them.
Instead we would try to keep a good shape and break when we could, something that seems to be working for a lot of teams at the moment.
So far this season, there has been a far greater percentage of away wins than in any of the previous 10 campaigns - 37% in 2015-16 compared to an average of 28% between 2005-06 and 2014-15 - and far fewer home wins - 34% compared to 47%.
It is fascinating to see there have been more away wins (26) than home wins (24) in the 70 Premier League games played so far in 2015-16 but that could be misleading because of how the fixtures have fallen so far.
Media playback is not supported on this device
A better way of showing that away teams are doing much better this season is to compare the games played so far with the corresponding fixtures from last season, replacing relegated teams with promoted ones and seeing how the results match up.
When you do that, 47% of the same fixtures last season ended in home wins, and only 27% saw away successes, meaning both figures are almost identical to the 10-year averages.
The increase in away wins is not just down to teams counter attacking, but it has been highlighted because West Ham, Leicester and Palace all play that way and they have produced some brilliant performances on the road.
As well as pace in attack, you need to be well organised defensively and stay patient and focused if you want to be successful playing on the break.
Look at West Ham, who have done exactly that three times to win at Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City.
The Hammers' back four, and the midfielders shielding them, were awesome in the way they stayed disciplined deep in their own half and held their positions. They were not getting the ball for long periods, which made it even harder.
That does not just happen by accident - it comes from work on the training pitch, as does fitness, which is another important factor.
It is a risky way of playing because if you do concede the first goal you obviously have to change your approach but that relies on more than just reacting with a change of tactics.
Leicester have shown with the way they have come back from a goal or more down so many times this season that their energy and fitness levels are really high.
It means that in the second half of games they can keep up the same tempo of play in defence and attack when the opposition is getting tired.
There are statistics for sprints and ground covered but none for the mental strength you need to play this way too.
Some attack-minded players want to express themselves and this is not a style of play for them - if two or three players in your team are not on board then it will not work.
Again, when I was with Fulham, we knew as a team and as a collective the way we were going to play and, even though we had our critics for being a bit negative, we knew it worked - even at home.
We made Craven Cottage a bit of a fortress under Roy Hodgson, even though if you sat in the stand we would often look like we were the away team.
We played deep because we did not have great pace in our centre-halves but we screened them well and we broke quickly, using the pace of Andy Johnson and Damien Duff and with Bobby Zamora to aim at as an out-ball.
I remember lots of games where I was back helping out our back four on the edge of the area and Andy would be next to me chipping in in the right-back area because we were hanging on to a 1-0 lead.
It worked for us, ultimately because of our results. If you win games playing that way, then your belief just grows and grows.
You can see that has happened with Leicester, even though they changed managers over the summer. Because of the way they finished last season they realised the way they were playing suited them, and they have carried that over.
One of the things about counter-attacking football is that it is not always pretty.
West Ham, Palace and Leicester are all near the bottom of the Premier League rankings for number of passes, passing accuracy and possession in 2015-16.
Does that matter? No, not if the results are good because then their fans will not care one bit. If anything, they will love it.
The important thing is that when they do attack, they do so with numbers and do it effectively, and all three of those teams can do that.
Yes, ideally you would like your possession ratios to be nearer 50-50 in games in order to be more competitive but when you look at the quality of the opposition that, say, West Ham have faced then you can understand why they had to sacrifice that.
Those statistics show why this style of play does not work for every club, though.
When I was at Liverpool, our passing, passing accuracy and possession was important to the way we played and part of the identity of the club.
There is no way we would have just played on the break at home, because our fans would not have accepted it.
They expected us to go after teams and, in contrast to when I was at Fulham, we would expect to dominate possession because, in most matches, we had the better players.
It is the same anywhere in Europe - you will never ever get the top teams with the best players going to a lesser team and putting men behind the ball, sitting back voluntarily and waiting to counter.
They will have the ability to do it but, unless they are up against someone like Barcelona, it will never be a game plan in the same way you see Palace, West Ham or Leicester do it.
Danny Murphy was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.","The document discusses the rise of counterattacking football in the Premier League, with teams like West Ham, Leicester, and Crystal Palace having notable successes playing this way.

""The untimely death at the age of 59 of the West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner Bob Jones, has brought about the first departure from office of any of the commissioners who were elected in November 2012.
The government's big idea in triggering PCC elections was to replace the old police authorities (considered by ministers to be invisible and ineffective) with high-profile figures, who would be directly accountable to local communities.
During his relatively brief time in office, Bob Jones nevertheless put his own distinctive stamp on the job, not least through the increased police precept added to council tax bills, to help fund a police recruitment initiative which reversed years of declining numbers in the West Midlands force.""
In 2010 he was awarded a CBE for services to policing.
Wolverhampton City Council leader Roger Lawrence said Mr Jones ""was a great public servant to Wolverhampton"".
""He will be greatly missed,"" he said.
Flags outside Wolverhampton Civic Centre were flown at half-mast in remembrance of Mr Jones.
Staffordshire's Conservative Police and Crime Commissioner, Matthew Ellis, said Mr Jones had succeeded in ""fundamentally changing and improving the way the police engaged with local people"".
""Although we didn't share the same philosophies, I liked Bob very much as a person and will miss the banter we had on so many occasions,"" he said.
""He was never afraid to speak his mind, even if this sometimes caused him to be in a minority of one among PCCs.""
At one point ""Bob Jones"" was trending on Twitter UK as people posted tributes.
Labour MP for Erdington Jack Dromey tweeted: ""Deeply saddened to hear the death of West Mids PCC, Bob Jones, a great champion of all that is best in British Policing & a very decent man.""
Former mayor of Wolverhampton Phil Bateman added: ""Bob Jones A Great loss, truly shocked, a man of huge integrity, and taken before his time. Making a job he didn't want successful!""
John McNicholas, chairman of transport authority Centro, said he was ""shocked and saddened"" at this news and added: ""Bob Jones was totally committed to the communities of the West Midlands and he will be greatly missed.""
A book of condolence has been opened at West Midlands Police's Lloyd House headquarters.
The first signatories were Bob Jones' deputy Yvonne Mosquito and West Midlands Police Chief Constable Chris Sims.
Mr Sims described Mr Jones as an ""outstanding politician"" and praised his ""unrivalled"" knowledge of policy.
""I shall miss his counsel, his obdurate commitment and sense of service to the people of the West Midlands,"" he said.

It features personal messages and artwork from children living in the detention centre.
Anyone who tries to reach Australia by boat to claim asylum is held in offshore centres, including on Nauru.
Australian government figures show that 92 children are in the Nauru centre, located about 4,500km northeast of Australia.
Nauru has banned Facebook across its tiny nation since April, saying social media can create instability.
It is not clear if the children who run the page will face any punishment if caught.
The Facebook page appears to have been started around 2 November.
The BBC has made contact with a person claiming to be the page moderator.
The person, who is not in Nauru, said they set up the page and advised the three page curators.
They use virtual private networks (VPNs) to get around Nauru's block on Facebook.
A message passed to the BBC, said to be from one of the teenagers, said: ""We want everyone to hear our voices and the situation we [are] going through. We want others to gives us hope and to help us to cope with [this] bad situation.
""We thought if we create this page many other [people] can see us and [walk] in our shoes.""
Under Australia's Border Force act it is illegal for anyone employed directly or indirectly by the immigration department to talk to the media about detention centre operations.
Charity Save the Children's offices on Nauru have been raided twice in an effort to find the source of an email that was leaked to the media.
But Save the Children told the BBC that the organisation was not responsible for the Free the Children NAURU page.
The group was providing education and welfare services for migrant children and families on Nauru until its contract expired last month.

450,"The images, which depict pubs run by the once-mighty London-based Charrington Brewery, were rescued from a skip by Robert Humphreys, where they had been dumped as the company moved offices a quarter of a century ago.
The brewery grew from humble beginnings in the 18th Century to own pubs across the country, many of which were thoroughly documented in regular surveys.
More than 3,000 photographs were rescued by Mr Humphreys, at the time an area manager for the brewery, and taken to the former Bass Museum, now the National Brewery Centre, in Burton-upon-Trent for safekeeping.
His actions preserved valuable information about pubs, landlords and drinking habits across the generations.
The National Brewery Heritage Trust (NBHT) has worked to share the archive with the public, and, after being scanned and cleaned digitally, the Charrington collection has been put online by Historypin as part of a nationwide project.
Mr Humphreys, who worked for Charrington for 20 years from 1973 and is now a member of the NBHT, said the pictures are ""priceless"" records of 20th Century life, and welcomed the efforts to open up the archive to the public.
""I think it's fair to say that this collection has some completely irreplaceable images,"" he said.
""Some are very high quality and were mounted on cards at the museum, which also had a lot of important information about the pubs, like old tenants, how much beer they sold and other things.""
NBHT chairman Harry White said he ""could not be more delighted"" with the digitisation, the first major project undertaken by the trust.
""This stunning collection was within moments of being lost forever,"" he said.
Due to his long association with the brewery, Mr Humphreys says he is still contacted by family members of former workers looking to find out more about their relatives.
He hopes opening the collection up will help more people contribute their own stories and shed more light on the life of Charrington Brewery and its employees.
""I'm so pleased it's happened - it could just so easily have disappeared,"" he said.
Lise Schauer, from Historypin, started working on the digitisation project in June. She said she was ""flabbergasted by the depth and quality"" of the archive rescued from the Charrington skip.
""I couldn't believe it was just going to be thrown away,"" she said.
Pete Boswell, managing director of digital specialists Photo Legacy, spent four and a half months digitising the photographs in the collection.
He hopes to work on bringing more old images of pubs to life.
""They're very interesting, and they have an appeal to many different types of people,"" he said.
""I'll certainly be working with other collections that aren't held by the trust. We've had some very good conversations, and I'm confident that we will be seeing more soon.""
The project is set to continue into next year, having secured funding from Amsterdam-based cultural heritage group Europeana Food and Drink, and Ms Schauer hopes visitors to the Historypin collection will add more historical photos to the site.
""We'd like to improve on what we've got - anything that makes the metadata richer would be great,"" she said.
""Pubs attract a lot of different types of people, they're a hub that a lot of people want to try and save.""
Ms Schauer has high hopes the Charrington photos can lead to a bigger social history project detailing the history of thousands of British institutions.

454,"Bill Leak, who created some of Australia's most recognisable and inflammatory cartoons, has died of a suspected heart attack in hospital. He was 61.
Last year, his caricature of an indigenous man with a beer can who could not remember his son's name was labelled ""disgusting"" and ""discriminatory"" by Aboriginal leaders. The artist had also faced death threats and was forced to move out of his home after publishing an image of the Prophet Muhammad following the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris.
""[He was] a giant in his field of cartooning and portraiture and a towering figure for more than two decades,"" said Paul Whittaker, editor-in-chief of The Australian newspaper, where Mr Leak worked.
The cartoonist was born in Adelaide but raised near Sydney, where he trained at the Julian Ashton Art School in the city's historic Rocks district. He would later travel to Europe to soak up the region's art, and it was in the early 1980s that he got his big break with The Bulletin magazine.
""I was the first person to get him to draw cartoons [and] his whole life changed,"" explained Lindsay Foyle, a cartoonist and cartoon historian.
""He had terrific control over the pen. He also had a mind which seemed uncontrollable. It would go in any direction and he was totally unpredictable, so it was combination of his drawing skills and his quirky sense of humour,"" Mr Foyle told the BBC.
""I don't think Bill was ever surprised about the controversy he caused. He enjoyed it and on many occasions tailored his cartoons to cause a stink. Bill enjoyed being in the limelight.""
Mr Leak won nine Walkley awards that recognise journalistic excellence in Australia, and had worked for Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Australia newspapers since 1994.
His distinctive style won many fans, but he often drew intense criticism for his views - particularly in recent years. Last year's depiction of the indigenous man sparked a complaint to Australia's Human Rights Commission, with a claim it had violated a controversial race discrimination law.
One indigenous advocacy group at the time called the ""disgusting, disrespectful, and hurtful"", adding: ""Those involved in publishing such a clearly racist cartoon should be ashamed and should issue a public apology to all Australians.""
Tributes on social media have praised his fearlessness, lamenting the loss of an artist who was ""supremely talented, principled, brave, witty & decent"", and ""a true warrior for freedom of speech"".
Others, though, had far more brutal assessments. Several posts after his death did not just attack Mr Leak's views, but the cartoonist personally - demonstrating how polarising he had become within sections of the community. Others swiftly condemned the critical posts.
Those close to Mr Leak say while he made a career rattling cages, an avalanche of criticism of his work in recent years had become too heavy a burden.
""Basically he was hounded to his death. He's had the most incredibly stressful couple of years,"" Spectator Australia editor and long-time friend Rowan Dean told the BBC.
""There were death threats after he did a cartoon that showed the Prophet Muhammad, which led to him having to move his house. He was Australia's version of Salman Rushdie for a while.""
""He did a very poignant but accurate cartoon about Indigenous Australians, disadvantage and the lack of parenting amongst Indigenous Australians and for that he was hounded mercilessly by our Australian Human Rights Commission. The pressure that he was under was just enormous.""
Defending his cartoon at the time, Mr Leak wrote: ""I was trying to say that if you think things are pretty crook for the children locked up in the Northern Territory's Don Dale Youth Detention Centre, you should have a look at the homes they came from.""
Many of his fellow cartoonists share the thought that Mr Leak was pilloried to the point of submission.
Mark Tippett, a Sydney-based caricature artist, told the BBC that his death was a terrible reminder of the battles they often face.
""What do we do as satirists if we can't satire anymore?"" he asked. ""Do we have to ask permission before we can put pen to paper? It just can't go on this way. It [his death] makes us more defiant. We can't go into a shell.""
""What he was trying to do is make his messages as simplistic as possible for many people to understand. His style would appeal to the masses because it was so clean and recognisable. You just don't see that every day.""
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has remembered his friend of more than 30 years.
""I can't believe that Bill Leak is dead,"" Mr Turnbull posted on Facebook. ""Who had more life, more energy than him? So many more cartoons to draw, paintings to paint, politicians to satirise.""
Indigenous leader Warren Mundine said Mr Leak ""was just an incredible cartoonist"". He told the Australian Broadcasting Corp: ""I'm just in shock. I was only with him the other night at his book launch and had a beer with him.""
Left behind are the cartoonist's wife Goong, his stepdaughter Tasha and his sons Johannes and Jasper.
His friends have remember a gifted man.
""Bill was an absolute genius,"" said Mr Dean. ""Here was a man who was one of Australia's greatest political talents. Probably one of the world's greatest satirists, certainly a brilliant cartoonist and also a brilliant portrait painter.""","Bill Leak, an Australian cartoonist known for his inflammatory and provocative work, has died at the age of 61.

The performances at the World Cup - where the Scots were a whisker away from a semi-final place after a heroic effort against Australia - gave Scottish fans hope that this team are growing into a force to be reckoned with.

""There's probably a little bit more expectation on us than on England. I hope they'll be able to deal with that expectation and deliver on the field.""
Wright:""We hope this is the start, particularly in the Six Nations, of better times. We've had a bit of a fallow time in the last few years. Two or three times over the last few years we've thought this is us ready to go, we've got a team.
""The key is getting that form back from the World Cup.""
Beattie:""Let's not listen to history. Forget all the guff that comes with the fixture. Forget that Scottish teams, in theory, aren't as good.
""I think they should just treat it like any other game. This season depends on this first game. If Scotland beat England, it could be an incredible ride from then on in. Opening up with a win is vital.""
Paterson: ""It's really important to get off to a good start. Scotland have won only one opening game since the inception of the Six Nations, so the stats are against us there.
""What is key to us getting a win is concentrating on ourselves. Get your own game right.""

""You would probably argue that the Scotland squad is more settled. That has to be an advantage.""
Paterson: Jonny Gray - ""We've got one of the hardest working, most impressive forwards in the Six Nations in Jonny Gray. He's a phenomenal player who just delivers every time.
""It would be really good to see him do what he's always done but get the reward for Scotland with some wins and hopefully Jonny can be at the forefront of that.""

""He's maturing every week into a player who is potentially world class. He could be crucial to any success Scotland have.""

The government has long been under international pressure to crack down on militants or groups suspected of supporting them. There was no immediate response from the government in Islamabad.
News that schools and hospitals run by Jamaat-ud-Dawa have received Pakistan state help is unlikely to go down well with the Indian or US governments.

Pakistan cleric to 'stay free'
Funding details came to light when the Punjab provincial government published spending figures for 2009-10.
""At least 80 million rupees [$940,000] have been allocated for the institutions [linked to Jamaat-ud-Dawa] during the current fiscal year,"" Rana Sanaullah, a senior Punjab minister, told the BBC.
However, he maintained that the institutions - which include two schools and a hospital - were no longer attached to Jamaat-ud-Dawa.
""The government has taken control of the schools and appointed an administrator to run each of them.""
He said the UN had been notified as the issue was a humanitarian one.
""There was a boys' school with 400 students, a girls' high school with 350 students and a hospital which addressed the needs of the entire area in question.
""If we had closed down the institutions it would have proved counter-productive. It would have aggravated the sentiments of the people and made them sympathise with [Jamaat-ud-]Dawa.""
When asked why the Punjab government had allotted money in the budget for institutions it managed, a spokesman for Jamaat-ud-Dawa, Hafiz Abdur Rehman, said: ""The truth is that we are ourselves astonished at this.""
He said the institutions in question were now being managed by the charity.
""When restrictions were initially imposed upon us, the Punjab government did appoint an administrator but it was neither liked nor accepted by our people.
""By the grace of God, now everything is running exactly the way it was running under the Jamaat's system.""
Jamaat-ud-Dawa has frequently denied accusations that some of its schools are used as militant training camps.
Its leader is Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, who set up Lashkar-e-Taiba, one of most feared groups fighting against Indian rule in part of the disputed territory of Kashmir.
After it was banned in Pakistan in 2002, the organisation divided itself into Jamaat-ud-Dawa and Lashkar-e-Taiba, correspondents say.
Jamaat-ud-Dawa now works as an Islamic charity all over Pakistan. It played a major role in relief efforts following the Kashmir earthquake in 2005.
Pakistan arrested Lashkar-e-Taiba's senior leaders after the Mumbai attacks. But most of them, including Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, were later freed on appeal.","The Punjab provincial government in Pakistan has admitted that it has allocated funds for institutions linked to Jamaat-ud-Dawa, a charity accused of being a front for the Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group.

The release of the IPCC report comes after an inquest into the death of Robert Cox - who was stabbed by Derek Hancock in 2013 - earlier this month.
The force said it now worked ""side by side with mental health professionals"".
Hancock pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of 24-year-old Robert Cox on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
The 42-year-old was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of four years and nine months in December 2014.
Described as ""deluded and psychotic"" in court, Hancock had repeatedly made false allegations that Mr Cox and other residents at supported accommodation at Egerton Road had made sexual advances towards him.
The inquest found Mr Cox was unlawfully killed and led to the publication of the IPCC's recommendations, which include:
Two police officers and two call handlers were cleared of any wrongdoing by an IPCC investigation.
A third call handler who told Hancock, who was threatening to take the law into his own hands minutes before killing Mr Cox, that it was ""entirely up to you"" was sacked by the force.
IPCC associate commissioner Guido Liguori said: ""These are tragic circumstances and I offer my sincere condolences to the family and friends of Robert Cox.
""The training and support provided to staff to engage and support people with mental health issues was inadequate, and it is concerning that the calls made by Mr Hancock from Egerton Road in the months leading up to the incident were neither linked nor marked as being made from a home with vulnerable residents.""

472,"While Britain's taste for a dram may be on the rise again, mostly thanks to higher-value single malts, that doesn't appear to be the case overseas.
And while salmon exports have recently been leaping ahead of other Scottish food and drink sales, they have taken a big dip in the past year.
Overall, new figures for Scottish exports of goods in 2015 saw them falling sharply, from £19.6bn to £17.5bn.
It can't all be down to the strength of sterling, as other food and drink exports are not taking anything like the same pounding, and nor is the UK
Scotland's total exports fell 11%, while the UK total was also down, but by less than 3%.
This is not just a one-year problem. The value of exports from England, Wales and Scotland decreased since 2012 by 4.8%, 8.3% and 12.9% respectively.
There is a lot of effort going into encouraging Scottish firms to get into exports. Yet the total numbers are going backwards. Scotland and the English Midlands are the only parts of the UK to see the number of exporters fall last year, according to the latest statistics.
And amid referendum-linked discussion of the importance of the European Union as an export market, it's striking that goods exports from Scotland to the rest of the EU last year fell by 20%, while UK goods exports to the EU fell 9%.
A lot of that was because output from oil refining was of much lower value, down two-thirds in Scotland's export figures, or £1.1bn. But there's more to it than that.
According to HM Revenue and Customs - with its first take on full-year figures issued on Thursday - exports of ""beverages"" from Scotland (overwhelmingly whisky) were down 4.4%, or £205m.
More widely, Scottish exports of food and drink fell 5% last year, and 6% the year before, while the UK figure was 3.6% last year, and steady the year before.
Those two years have seen increasing problems hit the whisky market - just when everyone thought it had found a sweet spot and was poised for years of expansion.
Exports had been surging ahead with the growth of middle class demand in emerging economies, across Asia to Latin America.
Nine new distilleries have opened recently, and the big distillers have spent vast amounts on expanding capacity.
Whisky came to represent around a quarter of all Scotland's exports (a worrying over-dependence?), and also a quarter of all food and drink exports from the UK.
That demand has come off the boil. The HMRC figures for Scottish ""beverage"" exports point to a 13% drop since 2012.
It seems there has been some cutting back on stockpiles of whisky held overseas. Chinese authorities have frowned on conspicuous entertaining and gifts of prestigious foreign liquor.
And two important Latino markets, Brazil and Venezuela, have hit very hard economic times.
That's why the British market has started to look a little more important. We learned on Wednesday that the number of Scotch whisky bottles released to the market in the UK was up from 83.3m to 84.9m bottles.
That goes against a trend of decline. British sales are down from 107m bottles a decade ago, and 111m back in 1995, when British tippling accounted for a tenth of output.
With rapid exports growth in the past decade, that share has fallen to around 7%.
Britain wasn't seen as the place to be lavishing marketing budgets, when Asia to Latin America were growing so rapidly and offered the promise of so much more.
These figures may get the marketing teams thinking again. The growth in British demand, according to the Scotch Whisky Association, is at the premium end of distilling, with single malts.
In 2005, distillers released 96m bottles of blended (lower-value) whisky to the UK market. In 2009 - the worst of the recession - demand dropped 10%, and it didn't come back.  Last year, demand was down to 72m bottles.
There was also a sharp drop in demand for single malts in 2009, down 14%. But it bounced back the next year.
In the decade to 2015, the number of single malt bottles sold into the UK market has risen from 11.5m bottle to 12.3m - up 4% and then 8% in the past two years.
Similar trends can be seen in the United States.  In mature markets, where the single malt used to be a profitable sideline, it is fast becoming vital to the industry's prospects.
And what of salmon? Scottish salmon also benefited from the growth in export markets. When China wanted to punish Norway for the Nobel peace prize going to a Chinese dissident, Scotland was given official trade approval and picked up the opportunity (it's mostly Norwegian owned, of course).
Chile, the world's other big salmon producer, suffered a hit to production due to fish disease, and again, Scottish fish farming was able to benefit.
But with Chile recovering, sterling strong, and Russia embargoed, there is tougher competition out there in the salmon cages.
According to the UK Food and Drink Federation, issuing its annual figures this week, salmon exports (and they are almost all farmed in Scottish lochs) were down a whacking £139m to £496m. That's a 21% drop in value. By volume, there was a big, but lesser, decline, of 8.6%.
That helps explain why Marine Harvest, one of the industry's biggest producers, has been laying off staff this week.
There is only one category that exports more food and non-alcoholic drink from the UK than salmon: chocolate.
The weakening of demand and strengthening of sterling helps explain a 1.7% drop in value last year, and 2.2% by volume. But at £580m, chocolate exports remain quite chunky.
If you're the kind who has to know, the Food and Drink Association tells us the next biggest British export categories that sell to foreigners are: cheese, beef, sweet biscuits, soft drinks, breakfast cereals, vegetables, chicken and sauces.
Only the biscuits, cereals and veg were on the rise last year. Overseas sales of chicken went down nearly as sharply as salmon.
If not whisky and salmon, and if the European Union is becoming less important, where are the growth areas for Scottish exports?
The latest HMRC trade figures show that the US remains the dominant export market. However, the fastest-growing export market is Saudi Arabia, up 35% or £127m.
And the fastest-growing export category, up eight-fold or £103m, is ""military arms and ammunition"".
The weapons aren't all destined for Saudi use, of course. But it's an odd combination, and not the image you might expect of Scotland the Brand.","Scotland's exports of goods fell by 11% in 2015, with a decrease in value of £1.1bn in oil refining and £205m in whisky.

474,"The probe, called Juice, has just been approved at a meeting of member state delegations in Paris.
It would be built in time for a launch in 2022, although it would be a further eight years before it reached the Jovian system.
The mission has emerged from a five-year-long competition to find the next ""large class"" space venture in Europe.
Juice stands for JUpiter ICy moon Explorer. The concept proposes an instrument-packed, nearly five-tonne satellite to be sent out to the Solar System's biggest planet, to make a careful investigation of three of its biggest moons.
The spacecraft would use the gravity of Jupiter to initiate a series of close fly-bys around Callisto and Europa, and then finally to put itself in a settled orbit around Ganymede.
Emphasis would be put on ""habitability"" - in trying to understand whether there is any possibility that these moons could host microbial life.
Callisto, Europa and Ganymede are all suspected to have oceans of water below their icy surfaces.  As such, they may have environments conducive to simple biology.
""People probably don't realise that habitable zones don't necessarily need to be close to a star - in our case, close to the Sun,"" explained Prof Michele Dougherty, a Juice science team member from Imperial College London, UK.
""There are four conditions required for life to form.  You need water; you need an energy source - so the ice can become liquid; you need the right chemistry - nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen; and the fourth thing you need is stability - a length of time that allows life to form.
""The great thing about the icy moons in the Jupiter system is that we think those four conditions might exist there; and Juice will tell us if that is the case,"" she told BBC News.
The mission will cost Esa on the order of 830m euros (£695m; $1.1bn) over its entire life cycle.  This includes the cost of manufacturing the spacecraft bus, or chassis, launching the satellite and operating it until 2033.
This sum does not however include Juice's 11 instruments.  Funding for these comes from the member states.  When this money is taken into account, the final budget for Juice is expected to be just short of 1.1bn euros.
It has not yet been decided which European nations will provide which instruments. An Announcement of Opportunity will be released this summer with a view to identifying the instrument providers by the start of next year.
The final and formal go-ahead for Juice should be given in 2014. In Esa-speak, this stage is referred to as ""adoption"".
It is the moment when all the elements required to build the satellite are in place and the full costings are established.
It is also the point at which any international participation is recognised.
At the moment, Juice is a Europe-only venture, but there is every possibility that the Americans will get on board.
The US space agency (Nasa) walked away from the idea of producing a companion satellite to Juice - a spacecraft that would orbit Europa rather than Ganymede - due to programmatic differences and budget concerns.
Nonetheless, there is a strong desire among the American scientific community to have some involvement in Juice, especially in those aspects that concern Europa.
Dr Britney Schmidt from the University of Texas at Austin is excited that Europe has chosen to fly Juice, and expects the probe's data to resolve many outstanding questions at the icy moon.
""We know that ice is a really good place [for life] to do business on Earth,"" she told the BBC.
""There's plenty of microbial and even some macroscopic organisms that use ice to make a living.  It's not so hard to imagine that life like that which lives in Antarctica and in the Arctic might be very possible on Europa.""
The Esa executive has put down 68m euros as a kind of placeholder, to give some idea of how much Nasa might like to contribute.  The sum is roughly the equivalent of two instruments.  However, it should be said that no explicit discussions between Esa and Nasa have taken place concerning which specific instruments might come from across the Atlantic.
One further issue needs to be resolved: the name of the mission.  The ""Juice"" label was dreamt up by the science team who devised the mission concept, but the researchers acknowledge there was a touch of humour in its creation.
They would like to use the name Laplace, after the great 18th/19th-Century French mathematician and astronomer Pierre-Simon Laplace.  A number of commentators would like to see Esa run a public competition to find a suitable mission name.
The Juice proposal was chosen over two other ideas - Athena, which envisages the biggest X-ray telescope ever built, and NGO, which would place a trio of high-precision satellites in space to detect gravitational waves.
These defeated concepts will probably now be entered into the next competition, due to be announced next year or the year after.

The Flag Code covers all aspects of etiquette in relation to the Stars and Stripes, including how to behave when the anthem is played. The code is never enforced, however, and there is no punishment for breaching it.
The code states that persons present are expected to stand and face the flag, if there is one. Civilians should stand to attention with right hand over heart, while military personnel in uniform and veterans should salute throughout. A recent amendment to the code said that military personnel out of uniform could also salute.
President Barack Obama famously neglected to put his hand over his heart during the 2008 election campaign. He explained his mistake by saying his grandfather taught him to do this only during the pledge, and to only sing during the anthem.

What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?
And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?
Men not in uniform should remove any headdress with their right hand and hold it at their left shoulder, the code states. This is generally observed at sporting events. NFL players may not put on their helmets until after the anthem is played.
The Flag Code makes no mention of whether the anthem should be sung by those present. However, singing the Star-Spangled Banner is encouraged from school onwards - in some schools it is compulsory. In 1942 the National Anthem Committee wrote that ""it is of paramount importance that emphasis be placed upon the singing of the National Anthem"".
Numerous manufacturers of flag merchandise could be in trouble here. The Flag Code states that it should not be used for any advertising purpose, and should not be embroidered or printed on any material for temporary use.
It should also never be part of a costume or sports uniform, or used as ""wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery"". Olympic medal winners who celebrate their success by covering themselves in the flag should take note.
Also, the flag should never be displayed upside down, except as a symbol of ""dire distress"".
Protesters throughout the world frequently set alight US flags to demonstrate their hatred of America, but you would not face prosecution for doing so in the US itself. In 1990 the Supreme Court invalidated a federal law against desecration of the flag on the grounds that it was in violation of the First Amendment on freedom of speech.
In fact, burning the flag is sometimes even encouraged. The Flag Code says that no disrespect should be shown to it, but also allows for any flag which is not fit for display to be ""destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning"".
Experts say that US flag etiquette is important because was created out of respect for the country's historical heritage.

478,"Champions Leicester travel to Chelsea to kick off the action on a Saturday on which leaders Manchester City face fifth-placed Everton and there is a London derby between Crystal Palace and West Ham.
The biggest game of this round of fixtures, however, comes on Monday as Liverpool take on Manchester United.
Here are some of the main talking points, as well as our guide of how to follow the action on the BBC.
After one win in four league matches for Antonio Conte's Chelsea, some bookmakers stopped taking bets on the Italian being the next Premier League manager to lose his job. He laughed that off in his news conference on the eve of Leicester's visit.
Saturday's game (at 12:30 BST) pits Chelsea midfielder N'Golo Kante against his former side - and the Foxes are missing the Frenchman, says captain Wes Morgan.
Morgan says what Kante did for the Foxes last season was ""incredible"" - he averaged 4.7 tackles and 4.2 interceptions per game, the highest in the Premier League in both categories.
His role at Chelsea has differed, however, with a greater emphasis on passing, playing 65 per game on average as opposed to 39 last season.
Next up for Leicester is a Champions League tie against FC Copenhagen - their previous two European matches have been preceded by 4-1 defeats in the Premier League.
Former England midfielder Jermaine Jenas told BBC Radio 5 live: ""I think Conte will be happy with how things have started to develop but he is clearly not comfortable with what he is seeing in a back four. He's been going with three at the back and two midfield enforcers.""
After a 35-year journey to the Premier League, which began at Ohio Bobcats, Bob Bradley has promised a ""fresh start"" at Swansea, who are 17th in the table.
Positivity in south Wales, then - something Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger craves.
The Frenchman this week reflected on the ""negativity"" sweeping Emirates Stadium after their home defeat by Swansea in March, adding: ""It is a virus that travels very quickly and goes away very slowly.""
The Gunners have not lost since the opening day, have kept four straight clean sheets and have Alexis Sanchez back in form with four goals in five games.
But the Chilean flew about 15,000 miles during the international break. Is he due a rest for Saturday's visit of the Swans (15:00 BST)?
Former England midfielder Leon Osman on BBC Radio 5 live: ""Bradley was a surprise appointment for me. I thought he'd maybe come in at Championship level but I wasn't in the interview room. Swansea have found it difficult to get back to what they were. Are they still that passing team?""
Sergio Aguero has scored 28 goals in his past 28 Premier League appearances for Manchester City. But, after flying roughly the same distance as Sanchez, will he start a potentially tricky home match against Everton on Saturday (15:00 BST)?
Aguero played 163 minutes, nursed a calf complaint and missed a penalty as Argentina drew with Peru and lost to Paraguay during the international break.
City boss Pep Guardiola said the 28-year-old and fellow forwards Kevin de Bruyne and Raheem Sterling are ""much, much better"" after recent injuries.
But will they play as the Blues look to bounce back from a first defeat of the season at Tottenham, or will they be saved for a Champions League trip to Barcelona?
Everton are fifth but without a win in two league games, and manager Ronald Koeman said: ""We know we can be better.""
Osman: ""No-one would be surprised if City were beaten at the Nou Camp, so if the Everton game doesn't go well they are on a bad four-game streak and people start asking questions - is there a mini-crisis? That type of thing starts to breed into the club.""
Stoke and Sunderland face each other at the Bet365 Stadium on Saturday (15:00 BST) as the only winless sides in the Premier League.
But both have come close to notching that elusive victory in recent games.
Sunderland threw away a 2-0 lead to lose 3-2 at home to Crystal Palace on September 24, the same day Stoke conceded in injury time to draw 1-1 with West Brom.
Stoke manager Mark Hughes said the onus is on his side to be positive in a match ""we need to win and feel we can win"".
Sunderland counterpart David Moyes, meanwhile, said he will ""find a way"" to get three points.

Both managers have called for calm among the fans at what could be the biggest game of the Premier League season so far.
But it could get heated on the pitch, too, in one of football's biggest rivalries, with plenty at stake as Liverpool host Manchester United on Monday (20:00 BST).
Jurgen Klopp's hosts are in red-hot form - having scored 12 goals in their past four games - while United have won only once in four league matches.
Jenas: ""Liverpool are out-and-out favourites. I don't think Mourinho knows his best XI. You could pick Liverpool's team right now. You can't do that with United.""

479,"The European Commission sent a statement of objections to the tech firm, alleging that it has breached EU competition law.
Google is accused of placing onerous requirements on firms using Android and stifling competition.
It said Android was ""good for competition and good for consumers"".
Kent Walker, Google's senior vice president and general counsel, said: ""Android has helped foster a remarkable and, importantly, sustainable ecosystem, based on open-source software and open innovation. We look forward to working with the European Commission.""
Speaking at a press conference in Brussels on Wednesday, the European competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said she had reached a preliminary view that Google was in breach of EU law.
It has been given 12 weeks to respond, and, if found guilty, the company faces a fine and could be required to change its practices.
Ms Vestager said Google had harmed both competitors and consumers by placing requirements on mobile manufacturers and operators to preinstall some of its own products and, in some cases, set them as default or exclusive options on handsets.
In some cases, she said, this had been as a condition of Google's agreement to grant a licence for the use of some of its apps.
Android is open-source software, meaning competing operating systems can be built using its source code.
The commissioner alleged Google had barred manufacturers from selling devices using these operating systems.
She also said Google had given financial incentives to manufacturers and mobile network operators on condition they exclusively preinstalled Google Search on their devices.
She told reporters: ""A competitive mobile internet sector is increasingly important for consumers and businesses in Europe.
""Based on our investigation thus far, we believe that Google's behaviour denies consumers a wider choice of mobile apps and services and stands in the way of innovation by other players, in breach of EU antitrust rules.
""These rules apply to all companies active in Europe.""
According to the European Commission, Google has about a 90% share in the markets for general internet search services, licensable smart mobile operating systems and app stores for the Android mobile operating system, making it dominant.
Ms Vestager said the issue was particularly important because smartphones and tablets accounted for most global internet traffic, and were expected to account for even more in the future.
She said about 80% of smart mobile devices ran on Android.
Lobbying group FairSearch, the lead complainant in the case, welcomed the decision.
""Google requires manufacturers using key apps on Android, such as Google Play or YouTube, to also install others that it specifies.
""Virtually every phone maker using Google Android in the European Union has bowed to Google's demands, suppressing competition by other app makers and preventing free choice for consumers,"" it said in a statement.
Google's history of run-ins with the regulators
2007 - US Federal Trade Commission investigates Google's acquisition of online advertising firm DoubleClick and rules it can go ahead.
2008 - US Justice Department blocks a deal to allow Yahoo to run Google search ads on Yahoo sites.
2009 - Rivals file complaints against Google to national regulators in Europe, citing competition concerns.
2010 - European Commission launches formal antitrust probe of Google's search business. This is still ongoing.
2013 -  FTC drops its two-year investigation of Google, concluding it had not manipulated search results to damage rivals.
2014 - European politicians pass a non-binding resolution calling for the break-up of Google's search engine business from the rest of the company.
2015 - New EU antitrust commissioner Ms Vestager charges Google with distorting search results to favour its own shopping services over rivals and reveals that she is also investigating Google's Android business.
Over these years, Google has also faced scrutiny from regulators in South Korea, Brazil, India and Russia.","The European Commission has accused Google of breaching EU competition law by placing onerous requirements on firms using Android and stifling competition.

480,"It's probably not every day that a museum will get a couple of drill bits in the post accompanied by a polite request to bore a hole in one of their highly valuable exhibits.
But those holding rhino horn can expect just such a package in the next few months as the National Wildlife Crime Unit roles out its database.
""The illegal trade in endangered species is one of our six wildlife crime priorities and, within that, the number one issue for us is the illegal trade in rhino horn,"" says unit head Det Insp Nevin Hunter.
In Africa, white rhino numbers are rising.
But despite this, a rapid rise in the incidence of hunting means that, if present trends continue, it won't be long before the population begins to dwindle.
Poachers are driven by the high prices paid in China and Vietnam for rhino horn - strongly, but wrongly, believed to have powerful medicinal properties.
Stealing antique rhino horn kept in the UK can deliver similar profits with much lower risks.
As one curator in East Anglia said to me: ""Thieves fleeing from a county museum are unlikely to get shot.""
In the past two years, there have been at least 20 criminal incidents involving rhino horn in the UK and it's not just old trophies at risk - live animals in zoos have been targeted.
PC Andy Long, a wildlife crime officer in Essex who advises Colchester Zoo on keeping its rhinos safe, says it is ""highly-organised crime at an international level"".
""They know how to obtain the horn and they know how to dispose of it - you can't just sell it on eBay,"" he says.
Some criminals also try to pass off freshly-poached specimens as antique.
The police say precise DNA knowledge will deter thieves, enable officers to secure more convictions and prevent smugglers making bogus claims.
It is part of an emerging effort to use the latest science to push back against smugglers and prevent them cloaking their crimes in the anonymity of their goods.
Ross McEwing, from international forensics service Trace, says: ""If we want to make inroads into the illegal trade in endangered species, DNA will certainly be the key tool to do that.""
Dr Lucy Webster, who is co-ordinating the government-funded science from a lab outside Edinburgh, usually spends her time investigating DNA at wildlife crime scenes.
But she is now using genetic science as a preventative weapon.
""This is where your DIY skills come in handy,"" she says.
""We'll be providing museums with a kit with which to take the sample including a 5mm drill bit.
""The shavings of rhino horn contain cellular material that has DNA within it and it's this DNA we will look to isolate to build the individual profiles.""
Zoos will be encouraged to gather cheek swabs or blood samples.
The precise technique will be left up to the keepers who know best how to get biological material from their potentially grumpy, two-tonne donor while giving least offence.
At Colchester Zoo, staff stroked Otto the rhino's ear, simultaneously calming the patient, bringing up a vein and slipping in a small syringe.
It didn't appear to interrupt his carrot and apple snack.

481,"The changes involve different measures for ranking sites and people checking results are accurate.
In a blog, Google said the changes should thwart attempts to abuse its algorithms that let extremists promote their content.
Google was criticised last year for giving prominence to groups seeking to deny that the Holocaust took place.
Ben Gomes, a vice-president of engineering at Google's search division, said it was making ""structural"" changes to tackle the new ways people had found to trick its algorithms.
In particular, he said, many groups and organisations were using ""fake news"" to help spread ""blatantly misleading, low quality, offensive or downright false information"".
To combat this, he said, Google had added new metrics to its ranking systems that should help to stop false information entering the top results for particular search terms.
In addition, he said, it had updated the guidelines given to the thousands of human raters it used to give feedback on whether results were accurate.
The guidelines included examples of low quality and fake news websites, said Mr Gomes, to help them pick out ""misleading information, unexpected offensive results, hoaxes and unsupported conspiracy theories"".
Google has done its best to play down the extent of fake news and hateful material - or what it prefers to call ""low quality content"" - in search results.
The company keeps repeating that this affects only 0.25% of queries.
But the fact that searches such as ""Is Obama planning a coup?"" - or even ""Who invented stairs?"" - produced such questionable results meant it had to act.
These searches threw up a prominent ""snippets"" box telling you that, yes, President Obama was planning a coup, or that stairs had been invented in 1948.
Now both boxes have gone, and Google's almighty algorithm has been tweaked so that such content is less likely to rise to the top.
What's interesting is that a company that has put such faith in technology solutions is turning to 10,000 humans to try to make search a better experience.
This giant focus group, which tests out changes in the search algorithm, has been told to pay more attention to the source of any pages rated highly in results, looking round the web to see whether they seem authoritative and trustworthy.
Questions are bound to be raised about whether this panel, which Google says is representative of its users, is impartial and objective.
Google's Ben Gomes, a veteran who's been wrestling with the intricacies of search since arriving as one of the earliest employees, believes it is now on the path to getting this right.
But with so many people trying to game the system, the battle to make search true and fair will never be over.
Google also planned to change its ""autocomplete"" tool, which suggests search terms, to allow users to more easily to flag up troubling content, he said.
Danny Sullivan, founder of the Search Engine Land news site, said the changes made sense and should not be taken to suggest that Google's algorithms were failing to correctly index what they found online.
""It's sort of like saying that a restaurant is a failure if it asks for people to rate the food it makes,"" he said.
""The raters don't rank results,"" said Mr Sullivan.
""They simply give feedback about whether the results are good.
""That feedback is then used to reshape the algorithms - the recipes, if you will -that Google uses.""","Google is making changes to its search algorithm to combat fake news and misleading information.

Natural Resources Wales (NRW) - responsible for landscapes and wildlife - will be asked to put sustainability at the heart of its decision-making.
AMs passed the bill unanimously, but opposition parties said it could have been more ambitious.
Natural Resources Minister Carl Sargeant said: ""This is a great day for Wales as the passing of the Environment Bill will ensure that the sustainable management of our natural resources will be a core consideration in all future decision-making.""
Other highlights of the bill, which had been three years in the making, include:
While the bill was passed unanimously, opposition parties spoke of missed opportunities.

Plaid Cymru spokesman Llyr Gruffydd said legislation to cut carbon emissions ""don't necessarily go far enough"" but were ""a step in the right direction"".
He added that Welsh Labour had missed an opportunity to give Natural Resources Wales ""an unequivocal remit for being the environment champion for Wales"".

485,"So who was right - them or the Labour leader?
Well, they both have a point.
There was a gap between what Labour was spending and what it was receiving in tax revenues in the few years before the great crash and recession of 2008.
But that gap was not massive: sometimes it was a tiny bit bigger than the growth rate of the economy, sometimes a bit smaller; which means there was no significant increase in the ratio of public sector debt to national income or GDP.
Thus in 2007-8, public spending was 40.2% of GDP, compared with tax revenues that were 37.5% of GDP: so the deficit was 2.7% of GDP.
Now there are plenty of economists and mainstream politicians who regard both public spending of that magnitude and a deficit of that scale as sustainable and indeed sensible.
And to put those figures into context, public spending by the government of Margaret Thatcher was significantly higher than that for her first seven years in office -  and she consistently ran a deficit of that scale till her last three years in office.
So it is quite hard to describe the fiscal conduct by the government of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown as wildly irresponsible. And, to be clear, neither George Osborne or David Cameron were at the time shouting that the Labour government was maxing out the credit card and was about to bankrupt Britain.
But that is not to let Miliband or his predecessors off the hook.
The Question Time audience did not seem altogether satisfied with the mea culpa that Ed Miliband did make, namely that Labour's mistake was to put in place inadequate oversight of the banks to prevent them behaving recklessly and mullering the economy.
And the audience's unease may not be irrational.
Of course the crisis would have been less acute if the Financial Services Authority and the Bank of England had taken earlier prophylactic action to prevent the banks lending and investing in their insane and greedy way.
But Labour wasn't just asleep at the wheel when it came to City regulation. Arguably it was drunk at the wheel - in that it loved the City boom, for generating huge tax revenues that it then lavished on public services.
So the failure to keep the City properly in check was in a sense wilful and therefore doubly wrong.
And there's another thing. Even best-in-class regulation of the City can't protect any economy from periodic shocks.
Which is why there is something to be said for George Osborne's favourite cliche, that it is sensible to mend the roof when the sun is shining.
Or to put it another way, when the economy is growing strongly, as it did through most of Labour's years in office, it probably does no harm to finance growth in public services largely through the proceeds of growth, rather than through borrowing.
Why? Well, the lower the national debt at the time recession bites, the more scope there is to borrow to protect public services and increase benefits, to shield people from the pain of recession.
The point is that since 2007-8, and as a direct result of the recession-induced collapse in tax revenues and surge in public spending on benefits, the national debt has doubled, from roughly 40% of GDP to 80% of GDP.
And the bleedin' obvious point is that if the national debt was today nearer 70% of GDP, almost the entire debate of this general election campaign wouldn't have to be about how much more austerity is needed and the timing of that austerity.
None of which is to say that the Tories are right to argue that the best thing for the economy at this juncture is to turn the deficit into a surplus as soon as possible: the Labour and Liberal Democrat case that a slower pace of welfare and departmental cuts would be fairer and better for our prosperity is supported by many economists.
What's more the debate remains lively (ahem) about whether the scale of cuts made by the current Tory and LibDem government in its early years was too great, and imposed too much hardship in the cause of regaining fiscal credibility.
But although Ed Miliband could plausibly argue that the Tories and LibDems forced more austerity on us than was necessary, it is not altogether surprising that his circumscribed admission of culpability for our economic woes causes a good deal of harrumphing.","The document discusses the fiscal conduct of the government of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, and whether their policies were sustainable and responsible. It argues that while there were gaps between public spending and tax revenues, these were not massive and the deficit was not significantly larger than the growth rate of the economy. The document also discusses the failure of Labour to properly regulate the banking industry and the consequences of this failure. It suggests that George Osborne's favorite cliche, ""mending the roof when the sun is shining,"" is relevant in this context, as it is better to finance growth in public services through the proceeds of growth when the economy is strong. The document concludes that while Ed Miliband could argue that the Tories and LibDems forced more austerity on the country than was necessary, his admission of culpability for the economic woes causes some harrumphing.</s>",mistral7b,XSUM,

But Archibald's less expensive side have secured a top-six finish.
""Based on resources, he's done arguably better,"" said Thistle general manager Ian Maxwell.
A 1-0 win over Motherwell on Saturday ensured the Glasgow side's first top-six finish since the top-flight league split was introduced and their highest finish in 26 years.
They could even match their 1977 feat of finishing fifth if they can overhaul Hearts' three-point lead in the six games before the end of the season.
All that has been made possible despite having the top-flight's second smallest budget.

""Obviously Brendan Rodgers has the chance to win a treble with Celtic, which would be a great achievement.
""But, if you look at things in perspective, for Archie to get us where we now are and the way it happened - with us being bottom of the league in December but then go on the run we've been on - then I think we can definitely say we've got our money's worth out of our manager.
""I think you could even make the argument he's a stronger candidate than Brendan.""

Gordon Strachan was the last Celtic manager to win the award, in 2009, despite the Glasgow outfit having now won six titles in a row.
""Celtic, with the best will in the world, are in a position where they should be winning the league,"" added Maxwell.

It also pledged more protection for consumers from spam email and nuisance calls, by ensuring direct consent is obtained for direct marketing.
And it reiterated its plans for driverless cars to be tested in the UK.
The Conservative Party pledged in its manifesto to increase protection for children online.
The forthcoming Digital Economy Bill will propose that all sites containing pornographic material must check that users are over 18.
The details of how this will work are not yet clear, and security expert Dr Gilad Rosner, who is a member of the Cabinet Office Privacy and Consumer Advocacy Group, said the government may struggle to implement the plan on free pornographic sites.
Peter Wanless, chief executive of the NSPCC, said the issue was ""a matter of urgency"" and that children who had ready access to adult content could develop a ""warped"" view of sexual relationships.
According to the government, one in five children aged 11-17 had seen pornographic images that had shocked or upset them.
Other plans include:
Last week the government confirmed that the Universal Service Obligation for broadband would be delivered ""on request"".
O2 chief executive Ronan Dunne said that the bill showed the government's commitment to getting better connectivity for the nation but more needed to be done.
""Whilst it is a step in the right direction for the rural areas not yet benefitting from mobile connectivity, investment in digital infrastructure is not just about reducing these connectivity blackspots.""
""Over 23 million people have now signed up to 4G and existing networks but even in major cities these networks will soon be overwhelmed by the demand for data, Solving this issue not only requires a bold, long-term vision, it requires leadership and collective effort by industry, government, local authorities, regulators and the public.""

It will include legislation to make sure drones and autonomous vehicles are safe and to alter the insurance regime to take account of driverless cars.

489,"A document uncovered by Harvard's student newspaper included ratings of the attractiveness of female players as well as sexually explicit comments.
University President Drew Faust called the behaviour ""appalling"".
The team, currently in first place in the Ivy League, will forfeit the rest of its games this season.
In what reports indicate may be a yearly tradition, male soccer players at Harvard circulated documents with pictures of their female counterparts, rating their attractiveness from one to 10 and giving reasons for their decisions.
They also noted which sexual position they thought the women in question would prefer.
Until recently, the Harvard Crimson newspaper reports, documents from 2012 were publicly accessible through a former team's Google Group.
Ms Faust said an investigation had found that the practice had continued to the current season.
She wrote that she ""was deeply distressed to learn that the appalling actions of the 2012 men's soccer team were not isolated to one year or the actions of a few individuals"".
Ms Faust added in a statement: ""The decision to cancel a season is serious and consequential, and reflects Harvard's view that both the team's behaviour and the failure to be forthcoming when initially questioned are completely unacceptable, have no place at Harvard, and run counter to the mutual respect that is a core value of our community.""
The discovery of sexually explicit comments made by male Harvard athletes is at the milder end of what has been dubbed US college ""rape culture"".
Banners regularly appear at the beginning of the academic year bearing slogans such as: ""Rowdy and fun. Hope your baby girl is ready for a good time"".
Studies have found that members of US college fraternities are three times more likely to commit rape than other male students while members of sororities were 74% more likely to experience sexual assault.
Past scandals include an email sent around one fraternity entitled ""Luring your rapebait""  and fraternity members chanting ""No means yes"".
The most recent case involved a Stanford University swimming champion who sexually assaulted an unconscious female student before being jailed for six months - a term condemned by many as too short.
Will Stanford sexual assault case silence future victims?
BBC Pop Up: Fraternity culture and stopping college rape
Last week after the original story came out, the female players in question said they were ""appalled that female athletes who are told to feel empowered and proud of their abilities are so regularly reduced to a physical appearance"".
In an opinion piece published in the Crimson, they said: ""More than anything, we are frustrated that this is a reality that all women have faced in the past and will continue to face throughout their lives.""
The university's director of athletics, Robert Scalise, said: ""It's very disappointing and disturbing that people are doing this.
""Any time a member of our community says things about other people who are in our community that are disparaging, it takes away from the potential for creating the kind of learning environment that we'd like to have here at Harvard.""

She also attempted to murder two men in Hereford.
In a High Court challenge, barrister Hugh Southey QC said continued isolation left her ""tearful and upset"".
Dennehy is challenging justice secretary Michael Gove over HMP Bronzefield's decision to continue to keep her separated from other prisoners, which entails long periods of isolation.
She is ""arguably the most dangerous female prisoner in custody"", Jenni Richards QC, for the prison, said.
More on this and other stories from Cambridgeshire.
Read more about 'the woman who murdered for fun'
Dennehy murdered Lukasz Slaboszewski, 31, Kevin Lee, 48, and John Chapman, 56, in March 2013 before dumping their bodies.
She went on the run and subsequently stabbed dog walkers Robin Bereza, 64, and 56-year-old John Rogers.
On Monday, the High Court heard Dennehy was initially segregated while on remand over fears of a prison break by her and other inmates.
One aspect of the alleged plan was that ""the finger of an officer would be cut off in an attempt to deceive the biometric security system at the prison"".
Hugh Southey QC, for Dennehy, said the escape allegations were never properly put to her and no further action was taken.
He told Mr Justice Singh that Dennehy's continued segregation was unnecessary and she was a victim of disability discrimination due to her mental illness.
She was a vulnerable inmate and she had, at times, resumed self-harming, he added.
Mr Southey said her legal team was seeking a court ruling that her segregation amounted to ""inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment"" which is banned by the Human Rights Convention.
Dennehy, it is argued, should be compensated ""to afford just satisfaction"" for the breaches of her rights.
Tom Weisselberg QC, for the Ministry of Justice, said segregation was a long way from ""solitary confinement"", and Dennehy had a radio, CD player, television and books, and access to the exercise yard, gym and shower.
They are also seeking to justify her segregation on the basis of the risks posed by the nature of her offending.
Mr Justice Singh is expected to reserve his decision until a later date.
Speaking after the hearing, Peterborough MP Stewart Jackson said the case was an outrageous misuse of the Human Rights Act and and an offence to the victims' families.","The document discusses the case of Dennehy, a woman who is serving life in prison for murdering three men in 2013 and attempting to murder two others.

491,"Rather like the arrival of a new Doctor Who, the role is the same, but it will look and sound completely different with someone else playing the part.
Apart from some rubber stamping - or an unforeseen political earthquake - the next Ofsted head will be Amanda Spielman, who has been formally recommended by the Education Secretary Nicky Morgan.
It will also mean the departure of Sir Michael Wilshaw, who has become the dominant figure in England's education landscape.
Outspoken and independent, he outlasted the previous education secretary, Michael Gove, and often outgunned the current incumbent Mrs Morgan.
There was little secret about the Department for Education's irritation at Sir Michael's readiness to speak uncomfortable truths that could clash head-on with flagship ministerial policies.
Before the announcement of the ill-fated plans to force all state schools to become academies, Sir Michael's comments about academy chain shortcomings infuriated the education department.
In fact, the only people more worried than ministers about Sir Michael's straight talking were his own press handlers.
Because in a political culture of private briefings, placed stories and pre-formatted comments, he spoke openly and was ready to explain and defend his views.
He overshadowed ministers because he didn't talk in the shadows.
Despite the talk of transparency, anything approaching old-fashioned press conferences, where education ministers could face scrutiny on their policies, are now as rare as hen's teeth.
But his shooting from the hip also made Sir Michael a very controversial figure.
Teachers' unions regularly accused Ofsted of putting unfair and counter-productive pressure on teachers.
There were also very robust run-ins with the private school sector, with independent school leaders left fuming by the Ofsted chief's accusations that they only wanted to share the ""crumbs from their table"" with state schools.
Sir Michael has said the credibility of Ofsted depends upon its independence - and he managed to make it very difficult to put him into any political pigeon-hole.
He was both a traditionalist and a maverick.
He often criticised the progressive, left-wing theorists running London schools in the 1970s and 1980s. But at the same time was sceptical of those right-wing ideologues eager to outsource as much as possible of the education system.
If there was one thing that defined his time as chief inspector, it was his decision to scrap the word ""satisfactory"" in Ofsted grades and to replace it with ""requires improvement"". It was at once arbitrary, absolutist and at the same time ambitious.
Anything less than good would not be good enough for state school pupils under his watch.
So what's going to be different when Sir Michael goes?
There is certainly going to be a change in style.
Sir Michael Wilshaw has been front-of-house for most of his working life.
Before running Ofsted, he spent 26 years as a head teacher in London secondary schools, making his name in high-profile efforts to improve schools in deprived areas.
Amanda Spielman has been a backroom operator, helping to set up the widely-praised Ark academy chain and as the chair of the exam regulator, Ofqual.
At Ofqual, when the exam regulator got tangled up in knots over changes to qualifications, she seemed to be a thoughtful and calming figure in the background.
Heads were deeply unimpressed by Ofqual's approach to exam grades, but Ms Spielman managed to stay above the fray.
But even before she has been officially given the Ofsted job Ms Spielman has been criticised by teachers' unions.
While the unions were not exactly enthusiastic fans of Sir Michael, they couldn't argue with his 43 years teaching experience.
But they have complained that Ms Spielman, a Cambridge-educated former accountant, has never been a teacher and is too close to the academy chain lobby to be impartial.
While she will expect to be attacked from the left, the most pressing challenge for Ofsted is likely to come from the right.
Sir Michael has been a formidable roadblock to deregulating a publicly-accountable state school system.
Even as a former academy head, he was much more interested in scrutinising the practical outcome rather than the ideological intent.
When the government didn't want Ofsted to inspect academy chains, he effectively got round this by ordering mass inspections of their schools.
Like many great head teachers, he walked the fine line between being relentlessly single-minded and being accused of tunnel vision.
And there will be calls to use his departure as an opportunity to ""cut Ofsted down to size"" and to keep the regulator in line with government policy.
This will be a tough challenge for Ms Spielman.
The role of education watchdog usually brings with it a raft of canine metaphors - and she won't want to be seen as the government's ""poodle"" or an ""attack dog"" for academy chains.
She also faces the rising challenge of what is in effect a parallel set of regulators, the regional school commissioners, who are officials appointed by the education department and likely to be much more docile to the demands of ministers.
The job of maintaining school standards is an intensely political balancing act.
Like a regenerating Doctor Who, Ms Spielman will have to escape the comparisons with previous incarnations and make sure she isn't upstaged either by the daleks or the zombies.","Amanda Spielman has been formally recommended by the Education Secretary Nicky Morgan to become the next Ofsted head, replacing Sir Michael Wilshaw.

The SEC said that over seven years, about 100 interns and full-time employees were hired at the request of foreign government officials, enabling JP Morgan to win or retain business that generated more than $100m in revenues.
It said: ""JP Morgan employees knew the firm was potentially violating the [Foreign Corrupt Practices Act], yet persisted with the improper hiring program because the business rewards and new deals were deemed too lucrative.""

But here's Newsround's run-down of some of the coolest things we already know about Pluto.
Pluto was officially discovered in 1930 by American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh, who was using one of the most powerful telescopes at the time at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona, USA.
Pluto was named by an 11-year-old schoolgirl from Oxford, England, who liked classical mythology and chose to name it after the ancient god of the underworld.
For more than 70 years Pluto was classed as a planet, until 2006, when the International Astronomical Union down-graded it to a dwarf planet.
A dwarf planet orbits the sun just like other planets, but it is smaller. Pluto is so small it cannot clear other objects out of its path.
Pluto is around 3.6 billion miles away from the Sun.
As Pluto has an oval orbit, it means it can sometimes be slightly closer, and other times further away, depending on where it is in its cycle.
As Pluto is so far away from the Sun it is very very cold, and scientists estimate the temperature of the planet to be around 375 to 400 degrees below zero.
Scientists think Pluto is made of rock and covered in ice.",Pluto was discovered in 1930 by an American astronomer and named after the ancient god of the underworld. It was classified as a planet for over 70 years until 2006 when it was downgraded to a dwarf planet. Pluto orbits the sun and is around 3.6 billion miles away.

It was handed down on 9 November and Facebook was given 48 hours to comply.
Facebook said it was negotiating with the BPC.
""We met with the BPC and provided them specific solutions addressing their concerns about our security cookie. This cookie helped us stop more than 33,000 account takeover attempts in Belgium in the last month, and similar cookies are used by most major internet services.
""We look forward to resolving this without jeopardising people's safe and secure access to Facebook,"" said Alex Stamos, chief security officer, in a statement.
A spokeswoman for the BPC told the BBC the judgement had yet to be formally served to Facebook because it is ""waiting for an English translation"" of the 33 pages.
The case hinged on a tracking cookie that Facebook has used for the last five years.
Research commissioned by the Belgian privacy authority found that non-members who visited a facebook.com page had the datr cookie downloaded on to their browser.
The court agreed that Facebook should remove the cookie for non-members and said that, if Facebook failed to comply, it could face fines of up to 250,000 euros (Â£180,000) per day.

""It would not make a lot of sense for the court or the parties before it to file these claims as thousands of individual lawsuits - which we can still do if a 'class action' is not allowed.

Officials believe they passed records of its discussions to journalists investigating Vatican corruption.
The documents form the basis of two new books on the controversial state of the Vatican's finances.
One of the journalists, Gianluigi Nuzzi, was involved in a previous leaks scandal at the Vatican, when Paolo Gabriele, butler to Pope Francis's predecessor, Benedict XVI, was found guilty of stealing and copying documents from the Pope's desk.
Gabriele was given a jail sentence but pardoned by Pope Benedict.
The Vatican has called the latest incident a ""serious betrayal of trust"".
Lucio Angel Vallejo Balda, a 54-year-old priest, and Francesca Chaouqui, 33, were both arrested by the Vatican gendarmerie at the weekend.
The Vatican has a recurring problem with secrets and leaks.
In 2012, Pope Benedict XVI's butler leaked documents which depicted infighting at the highest levels of the Church.
Some believe that this contributed to Benedict's decision to step down the following year.
Pope Francis promised a new kind of administration. Four months after his election, he created a commission designed to end mismanagement within the Curia, the bureaucracy of the Church in the Vatican.
By ordering a clean-up, the Pope inadvertently created material for a new round of leaks.
The Vatican now accuses two commission members of passing records of its discussions onto journalists.
Despite his best intentions, Pope Francis now faces the publication of details embarrassing to the church he leads.
His 88-year-old predecessor, retired to a converted Vatican convent, will sympathise.

The two books, due to be published this week, are expected to reveal allegations of financial mismanagement as well as the extent of resistance to Pope Francis's attempts to reform the Vatican.
Renowned L'Espresso journalist Emiliano Fittipaldi has entitled his book Avarice: Documents Revealing Wealth, Scandals and Secrets of Francis's Church.
Meanwhile, Gianluigi Nuzzi's publisher, Chiarelettere, has said his book includes details of private meetings between high Vatican officials and the Pope.

The reasons for that imbalance are widespread and UK Coaching is keen to stress the many social and health benefits offered by coaching beyond the development of elite sporting talent.
There are many ways to get involved, so as part of Women's Sport Week, we've looked at some examples of women from across the sporting spectrum and their efforts in helping to close the gender divide in coaching.
Four years ago, Danielle Guy had never done any running. Now the 24-year-old from Cambridge leads a local running group, with more than 50 members attending at least once a week. How did that happen?
""I never had the fitness or stamina to enjoy running, but I had heard about the NHS Couch to 5K programme and in the new year of 2013, after too many chocolates, I was determined to complete it,"" she recalls.
She was bitten by the running bug - ""it was so incredibly rewarding to see myself go further week after week"" - stepped up from 5k to 10k, then half marathon and ended up running the 2015 London Marathon.
Wanting to share her positive experience, Danielle qualified as a Leader in Running Fitness (LiRF) with England Athletics and started Let's Run Girls, a mixed-ability running group with weekly sessions varying from walk-run to steady 5k, circuits and sprints.
And it's not just to encourage others that the group has been useful. Danielle cites her new-found responsibilities as great self-motivation.
""There's very little chance I would head out on my own for a run at 7.30pm on a cold, dark winter's evening,"" she admits. ""But knowing there is a group there waiting for you makes it an easy decision. I feel part of a really great community of like-minded women who never fail to surprise and impress me.""

Cricketer Lydia Greenway enjoyed a stellar career with England - winning five Ashes series and two World Cups - before retiring in 2016.
Now, the 31-year-old has embarked on a new challenge - Cricket for Girls - marshalling the expertise of former team-mates and current players to deliver coaching sessions at schools and cricket clubs around the country.
Find out how to get into cricket with our inclusive guide.
She recalls how important mentoring was for her at an early age: ""Looking back, if it wasn't for my family, I may not have played cricket,"" she says.
""At the time, it wasn't a sport that was readily available for girls in schools, and our club was one of a few who helped build a women's team and embraced a girl playing in a boys' team. My dad was my role model because at the time I didn't even know there was an England Women's cricket team!""
Lydia has quickly come to realise how important it is to offer female mentoring across the range of ages and abilities.
""Female role models help break down the barrier and perception that cricket is a boys' game."" she says. ""Cricket for Girls aims to allow every single girl who wants to play cricket the opportunity to do so, as well as providing those girls who already play with high-quality and expert coaching.""
Find out more about Cricket For Girls' wide variety of coaching sessions and how you can involved, here.
While Lydia is just starting out on her journey as a coach, Jane Lomax has the years of experience that make her an invaluable advocate for women's coaching.
Over the years, Jane - a coaching tutor and assessor for England Netball - has empowered countless women to take on netball coaching roles and continue their learning, building self-esteem and confidence.
""Research tells us it is the rapport that coaches have with their performers that is one of the most important influences on participation and at the root of that is communication,"" she says. ""'Softer skills' are paramount - women are often very strong on softer skills so can make very successful, positive coaches.""
And as much as these positive effects filter through to participants, it is the benefits to the coaches themselves that Jane is particularly keen to stress.
""I have seen many coaches whose confidence is low and who can be very self-critical,"" she explains. ""But once they start to realise that others have a very different perception of them they can really start to grow.
""So there are social and emotional benefits available for coaches. This can be really helpful when returning from gaps in careers due to being a mum. One of the most delightful parts of working with coaches is to witness the growth of self-confidence women can experience.""

The hall, on the corner of Stokes Road and Parson's Green, was built with the deeds saying the site was sold ""for an Institute for the women of Kelly Bray"".
The CFWI said in a statement: ""The hall was established specifically for the use of WI and not for village hall purposes.
""The recent actions of the village hall committee to force entry in the building, change the locks and deny access to the trustees of CFWI are not only highly regrettable but also illegal, and the trustees are seeking a way forward through discussions with their lawyers.""
The village hall committee rejected the WI's claims, saying that according to their interpretation of the deeds, the hall was purchased by the village for the use of the WI ladies and they have vowed to carry on using it.
It said the hall had been used over the years for events such as Christenings, wakes, dog-grooming classes and Young Farmers' pantos as well as the WI.
Susie Iannantuoni, from the village committee, said villagers had been ""horrified"" when the hall was locked by the WI.
""We have money to pay the bills, we have insured it and running repairs are being done.
""I think the situation is dreadful. We have the same aims as the WI, to have the hall for the community and reach out to people.

513,"Ahmad won 34 of the 54 votes in the election, which was held in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa on Thursday.
The result means a change in leadership for the first time since Cameroonian Hayatou took charge in 1988.
Ahmad, who appeared very emotional, becomes only the seventh Caf president in the body's 60-year history.
The 57-year-old, who goes by a single name, told BBC Sport afterwards: ""I can't talk at this time. Only one thing - I thank God, I thank my team.
""We worked hard but we won. That was the first step. The second step is to develop African football.
""Some days I thought I would win - today I didn't (think I would win).""
The result was greeted by cheers at the Caf congress as Ahmad was carried on the shoulders of jubilant supporters to the podium after the result was announced.
In contrast, Hayatou was led from the auditorium by aides but he told reporters as he departed: ""It is not that bad.""
Ahmad later added: ""When you try to do something, you mean that you can do it. If I can't do it, I never stand.
""This is sweet victory. When you work hard for years and months and you succeed, that is great.''
Ahmad, who became Madagascar FA chief in 2003, takes over as Caf president on an initial four-year term, and has promised to modernise the body and make it more transparent.
His first job, he said earlier on Thursday, would be to introduce a new code of ethics and he has also pledged to extend ethics checks on African football officials.
The departure of Hayatou is a huge change for African football and the 70-year-old will also lose his Fifa position and his place on the ruling council of world football's governing body.
He had been challenged for the Caf presidency only twice before and both times won with landslide victories.
This time he won only 20 votes, ending his hopes of winning an eighth term in office that would have seen his presidency extend for more than three decades in total.
""His excellency Issa Hayatou has done a lot for African football (but) it is time for him to step back,"" said George Afriyie, vice president of the Ghana Football Association.
Liberia Football Association President Musa Bility added: ""Africa has made an emphatic decision that we are ready for change.""",Ahmad won the election for the presidency of the Confederation of African Football (Caf) with 34 out of 54 votes.

Sanctions were also slapped on wealthy businessman Samark Bello, described as Mr Aissami's ""primary frontman"".
Mr Aissami was appointed last month by President Nicolas Maduro.
There was no immediate response from him or Mr Bello. but Mr Aissami has previously denied criminal ties.
The sanctions freeze the vice-president's assets in the US and bar him from entering the country.
The US Treasury statement says Mr Aissami facilitated huge shipments of narcotics from Venezuela by air and sea. It also says he was in the pay of convicted Venezuelan drug lord Walid Makled for the protection of drug shipments.
John E Smith, acting director of the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, said the sanctions were ""the culmination of a multi-year investigation under the Kingpin Act to target significant narcotics traffickers in Venezuela and demonstrates that power and influence do not protect those who engage in these illicit activities.
""This case highlights our continued focus on narcotics traffickers and those who help launder their illicit proceeds through the United States,"" he said.
Mr Aissami was previously the governor of Aragua state and served as minister of the interior and justice in Venezuela from 2008 to 2012.
US media, citing leaked intelligence documents, say Mr Aissami has also been under investigation in the US for suspected ties to the militant group Hezbollah.
During his time as interior minister, fraudulent Venezuelan passports ended up in the hands of members of the Lebanese group, it is claimed.
Earlier this month, 34 members of the US Congress sent a letter to President Donald Trump asking for sanctions against Venezuelan officials.

David Cameron says he will press the issue to a vote if Mr Juncker is nominated at an EU summit on Friday.

Previously, the top job in Brussels bureaucracy has usually only been given with the unanimous agreement of at least the bigger countries, including Britain.
'Not an arch villain'
The British prime minister has fought a lone campaign to block Mr Juncker becoming the next EC president, saying his appointment would ""ignore the clear pro-change and pro-reform message"" delivered by European voters in last month's election.
If Mr Juncker's name is tabled at Friday's EU summit in Brussels, Mr Cameron has said he would demand an ""unprecedented"" vote to put on the public record EU leaders' views on the ex-Luxembourg prime minister.
Speaking in Berlin on Tuesday, Mr Juncker said he expected to be the next EC president by the end of the week ""if common sense prevails"".

Number eight Picamoles replaces Bernard le Roux in the back row for the Pool D decider in one of two changes from the 41-18 win over Canada.

Both France and Ireland have won their opening three games in Pool D and the losers of Sunday's match are likely to face New Zealand in the quarter-finals.
Henderson's demotion to the replacements is a big call by Ireland coach Joe Schmidt, with the New Zealander believing that six foot 11 inch Toner is needed to disrupt the effectiveness of the France line-out.
Yet Henderson's energetic work around the field has probably been the most impressive feature of Ireland's World Cup so far.
The Ulsterman was man of the match in last weekend's narrow win over Italy and is certain to come on during the Millennium Stadium contest.
Schmidt said the decision to recall Toner had been ""a really tight call"".
""Dev has been a big-match player for us and gives us a little bit more line-out capability,"" added the Ireland coach.

519,"But we've got it wrong, and contrary to our expectations, we could actually learn from psychopaths, argues Oxford University experimental psychologist Kevin Dutton.
""It's true, when psychologists like myself use the word psychopath, images of killers like Ted Bundy go flashing across most people's minds,"" he says.
However, he argues that we could all benefit from sometimes being more ruthless, fearless, self-confident, focused, mentally tough, charming or charismatic - all of which are traits of a psychopath.
None of these is a problem in itself, he says, the danger comes when ""all these traits are turned up too high, and that's when you start getting individuals who are dysfunctional"".
""I am not glamorising violent criminal psychopaths,"" Prof Dutton points out, ""because these guys completely devastate other people's lives.""
In his new book, The Wisdom of Psychopaths, he says that adopting certain psychopathic characteristics can help us improve our own performance in the workplace.
Psychopaths tend not to procrastinate or take things personally, ""and they don't beat themselves up when things go wrong"", he says.
""If you're putting in for a rise, you might feel a little anxious about doing that - what would happen if I don't get it, what would my boss think about me?
""Well, just have the courage of your convictions and go for it. Don't focus on the negatives, focus on the positives.
""By doing that it makes you more confident, and more likely to get what you want in the first place.""
Even a lack of empathy with others - common among psychopaths - can be useful in certain jobs.
Source: Kevin Dutton, author of The Wisdom of Psychopaths
""Imagine you've the skill set to be a great surgeon - but can't dissociate yourself emotionally from the person you're operating on,"" says Prof Dutton.
""One surgeon told me that as soon as you start thinking of that person as someone's wife or husband, you're beginning to walk an emotional tightrope.
""That's where dissociating yourself from people can predispose you to success.""
People with these kinds of characteristics are often suited to any number of high profile roles, he argues - such as chief executives, lawyers or even journalists.
Politicians too, can often exhibit certain psychopathic traits.
""Successful politicians need to be remorseless at implementing policies in the face of opposition,"" says Prof Dutton.
""If you think of it, the most successful politician is someone who says what most people are thinking.
""They are brilliant at slipping into people's air space, they are psychopathic cat burglars.""
However, some other psychologists counter that psychopaths only account for about 1% of the general population, and to define them as Kevin Dutton does is too broad.
""It is wrong to describe these people as psychopaths - that's a clinical definition,"" says Prof Cary Cooper, of Lancaster University Management School.
""They are not going to kill anybody - but indirectly they can damage people because they are so focused on their own success and totally oblivious to the needs of others.
""It is basically an abrasive, bullying management style.""
Yet setting aside the question of how psychopaths should be defined, Jonny Gifford, of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), agrees with Prof Dutton that we can learn from these behaviour traits.
""Many of us don't like organisational politics, but we need to be realistic, to recognise that sometimes there is a need to be politically wily.
""Sometimes there is a need to be tough. We just need to do that in a way which maintains integrity and is ethical.""
Of course, the trick is knowing what is ethical in the first place.
""It's all very well saying you should work to your own values - but your values may stink,"" says Gifford.
Kevin Dutton talks to Justin Rowlatt about learning from psychopaths
How important is  charismatic leadership at the top of a company?
Business Daily - home
In the Balance - home
While those who are out only for themselves and not for their colleagues may bring short-term gains, in the long run they can prove problematic for organisations.
""They do very well, but the team suffers,"" says Jonny Gifford at the CIPD.
It is important to realise that there will always be cut-throat people within organisations, he says. From a company's point of view, the trick is to control this type of behaviour, to rein in some people so they don't damage the firm by their actions.
For his part, Kevin Dutton says that sometimes ruthlessness and a lack of empathy is exactly what a manager needs to run a big company.
""Imagine if you've got the strategic and financial nous to be a top businessman but you lack the ruthlessness to fire people who aren't pulling their weight, or the coolness under pressure to ride out a storm, you're never going to be a top captain of industry, are you?""
But for those who think they may have a boss with out-of-control psychopathic tendencies, he has this advice.
""If your boss has a tendency to step on those beneath him but goes out of his way to impress those above him - it's time to move.""","Oxford University experimental psychologist Kevin Dutton argues that we could all benefit from sometimes being more ruthless, fearless, self-confident, focused, mentally tough, charming or charismatic - all of which are traits of a psychopath.

Yvette Cooper, Andy Burnham, Chuka Umunna and Liz Kendall have already declared their intention to stand.
Meanwhile, shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt has told BBC's Question Time he is ""interested"" in the role.
He said he would speak to party members on Friday.
Another potential candidate is Copeland MP Jamie Reed, who had a health brief under Mr Miliband. Talking to BBC Radio 5 live on Thursday, he repeated suggestions he was considering a bid.
Candidates must secure nominations from 34 colleagues - 15% of the party's MPs - by 15 June to make it on to ballot papers, which will be sent to members in August ahead of the leader's election a month later.
Ms Creagh is the least high-profile of the candidates to declare so far but - as shadow environment secretary - took on the coalition government over the horsemeat crisis and attempts to sell off England's state-owned woodlands.
She told the BBC Labour had failed to speak to people about ""how they could win in the global race"" and that her background of 10 years in business and ""real experience of town hall Labour"" could help win over voters.
""We have got to look at those areas which trust Labour to run their council services but where they chose not to put their trust in us to run the country,"" she said.
""We have to earn back the trust of large swathes of middle England who didn't trust us to run the economy for them and also to win back voters who chose the Scottish National Party... and large swathes of our industrial heartlands who chose UKIP.""
Ms Creagh's decision to stand came after shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper set out her case for Labour's future, cautioning against going ""back to remedies of the past, be that of Tony Blair or Gordon Brown"" because the world had changed.
""We've got to have a much bolder vision for our future, much bigger ambitions for people in this country,"" she told the BBC.
""If this leadership election is just about the Labour Party, that is not going to answer the real concerns families across the country have about their future.""
Shadow health secretary Mr Burnham had announced his intention to stand via a video, arguing: ""Our challenge is not to go left or right, to focus on one part of the country above another, but to rediscover the beating heart of Labour.
""That is about the aspirations of everyone, speaking to them like we did in 1997.""
Mr Umunna, the shadow business secretary, has said the party must address the aspirations of people ""all the way up the income chain"", while shadow care minister Ms Kendall has suggested Labour lost the election ""because people didn't trust us on the economy"".

523,"The six-storey residence in Kenya's capital Nairobi came down in heavy rain, with more than 80 people still missing.
While investigations are still underway into the cause of this collapse, we look at some common problems.
Adequate foundations can be costly.
They can cost up to half the price of a building, observes professor of civil engineering Anthony Ede at Covenant University in Ota, Nigeria.
He says two things should be considered when you are building the foundations - the solidity of the soil and the heaviness of the building and its contents.
In the commercial capital of his country, Lagos, the swampy ground requires strong foundations. Far stronger than solid ground.
But he says developers save money that should be spent on foundations when building on the city's swampy ground and many buildings have collapsed in Lagos as a result.
Even on solid ground, foundations need to be strong enough for the load.
Inadequate foundations for a four-storey building was one of three reasons given by investigators for a building collapsing in northern Rwanda in 2013 and killing six people.
Materials that just aren't strong enough to withhold the load are used, says Hermogene Nsengimana from the African Organization for Standardisation, whose organisation met last month in Nairobi to discuss why so many African buildings collapse.
He suggests there is a market for counterfeit materials - going as far as to say that sometimes scrap metal is used instead of steel.
When a six-storey building in Uganda's capital Kampala collapsed in April, the director of the city authority suggested it had been constructed with counterfeit materials, reports Ugo news site.
Mr Nsengimana says there are even cases of counterfeiters faking authentification certificates.
But he suggests contractors also knowingly use the incorrect materials to cut costs.
So they may use concrete intended to bear the load of a one-storey building in a four-storey building.
Mr Ede adds that this is something regulators are not policing.
Even when workers are given the right materials to make the concrete, they mix them incorrectly, says Mr Ede.
This results in concrete which is not of the sufficient strength to hold the load.
He accuses developers of cutting costs by employing unskilled workers who are cheaper than trained builders.
This is one of the reasons put forward by civil engineers Henry Mwanaki Alinaitwe and Stephen Ekolu why a building in Uganda collapsed in 2004.

Mr Ede says a building collapses when the load is beyond the strength of the building.
He gives the example of asking a baby to carry a heavy box: ""The baby will not be able to withhold the strain.""
Even if the foundations and the materials are strong enough for what they were originally built for, that purpose may change.
So, Mr Ede says, if a building was designed to be a home and is then turned into a library where boxes and boxes of books are piled up, the building may strain under the weight.
He says another reason why the load is often heavier than the original design is because extra storeys are added.
In March an upmarket apartment block which had more storeys than planned collapsed in Lagos, killing 34 people the Guardian reported.
This came two years after a church accommodation for the famous preacher TB Joshua collapsed, also, authorities said, because it had more floors than it could hold. In that case more than 100 people lost their lives.
At all points of construction the strength of the building should be tested, says Mr Ede.
""You have to be strict,"" he says, about policing building.
""The law says you must test. It's the enforcement of the law  which is the problem,"" he says.
That's a big problem, he says, when at every stage of construction there is someone with a strong motivation to save money or take money.
There are many physical reasons a building can collapse but only one driving motivation for that to happen, says Mr Ede. That's money.
And for him this is the real reason buildings collapse - corruption.","The six-storey residence in Kenya's capital Nairobi collapsed, resulting in the death of more than 80 people. The cause of the collapse is still under investigation, but common problems that can lead to building collapses include inadequate foundations, use of weak or counterfeit materials, and corruption.

The son of a doctor from Guildford, Tony Blackburn was the first DJ to broadcast on Radio 1 when it launched in September 1967. He spent 17 years at the station and also presented Top of the Pops and was a weekly fixture on Noel's House Party. Prior to all that, he had broadcast on Radio Caroline South and then Radio London.
After Radio 1, he was one of the launch presenters on Capital Gold. He has also hosted Radio 2's Pick Of The Pops as well as regular bank holiday specials for the stations. He has also had shows on BBC London 94.9, BBC Radio Berkshire, the Magic network, BBC3CR and KMFM.
In 2002 he won the ITV reality TV programme I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!
Blackburn's new Radio 2 programme will replace the show currently hosted Desmond Carrington, who announced last month he was retiring after 70 years in broadcasting.
Dame Janet Smith's inquiry had rejected the evidence from the Radio 2 DJ.
Blackburn, who had threatened to sue the BBC, said the report included an accusation he was among celebrities who ""seduced"" a 15-year-old girl.
In a statement, he denied the allegation and said he was cleared of wrongdoing.
He accused the BBC of making him a ""scapegoat"" for its own ""cover-up"" of abuse.

535,"In a new report, commissioned by Downing Street, he says that people think the UK ""does not have a strategy for growth and wealth creation"".
He wants to devolve power from London to the English regions.
In the Commons, David Cameron and Ed Milliband argued over whether the report backed or damned the government.
Lord Heseltine's report, No Stone Unturned, makes 89 recommendations to help industry. One of its key aims is to move Â£49bn from central government to the English regions to help local leaders and businesses.
The aim, he said, was to devolve power from Whitehall and re-invigorate the big cities that had fuelled the growth and wealth that the country had enjoyed in past decades.
Lord Heseltine, head of the Department of Trade and Industry in the 1980s, said the government should allocate growth funds through the new Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) that are being established in England in place of Regional Development Agencies.
By Nick RobinsonPolitical editor
In 2010, the government invited local business and civic leaders to come forward with proposals for establishing LEPs that reflected natural economic geographies.
Lord Heseltine believes these bodies could be key to stimulating regional growth, but said that, at the moment, LEPs did not currently have ""the authority or resource to transform their locality in the way our economy needs"".
At the national level, however, the government should show greater leadership in promoting major infrastructure projects, Lord Heseltine said. A national growth council should be created, chaired by the prime minister and with a cross-government focus.
""Central government must retain control of important, large scale infrastructure projects. This includes our motorway network, national rail network and airports, as well as our energy networks,"" Lord Heseltine said.
In all these sectors, there must be greater investment and a clearer strategy of what the UK needs. He cited the delay and ""inertia"" over building extra airport capacity in the south east, and called on all the political promises to make firm commitments in their next manifestos about how they will resolve the problem.
Profile: Heseltine still making waves
Lord Heseltine also backed suggestions that pension funds should provide funding for infrastructure projects. With yields on investments in stocks and shares at historically low levels ""there is a well of money looking for a better return than currently available in the market,"" he said.
He said that throughout the regions there was excellence in industry, commerce and academia, which should be extended and that cities were ""pulsing with energy"" that should be unleashed.
He backed the government's economic strategy, and said it was taking the right path to recovery. But later, in an interview with the BBC, Lord Heseltine said there was ""an urgency"" about stimulating growth. ""Across the world there are emerging economies that want our jobs and our wealth,"" he told the Today programme.
""We need to mobilise the skills of provincial England. I want to shove power out of Whitehall, into the provinces,"" he said, adding that ""London has acquired too much power"".
Lord Heseltine admitted his ideas would go down like a ""lead balloon"" in parts of Whitehall because he was suggesting government departments should lose some of their power.
Asked whether his conclusions might be at odds with thinking in the Treasury, Lord Heseltine said: ""I do not work for the Treasury, I work for George Osborne. And George has been behind this initiative.""
He added: ""I have got baggage, they know my views. There are bound to be things where they say, 'oh my god, here he goes again'. I have told it as I see it, but I have told it in a way that is very supportive of the government.""
In the Commons, the Conservative and Labour leaders disputed the report's sentiments. Mr Milliband said that Lord Heseltine's comment that people believe there is no growth strategy was damning.
But Mr Cameron cited the report's conclusion that the coalition government was ""on the right track"". He added that it was an ""excellent"" report, and told Mr Milliband that it was pointless to just trade quotes
Chancellor George Osborne said he would ""study it [the report] very carefully"". He said: ""I wanted Lord Heseltine to do what he does best: challenge received wisdom and give us ideas on how to bring government and industry together. He has done exactly that.""

547,"The aim is to see if computers can learn, in the same way a human would, what links images, to help them better understand the visual world.
The Never Ending Image Learner (NEIL) program is being run at Carnegie Mellon University in the United States.
The work is being funded by the US Department of Defense's Office of Naval Research and Google.
Since July, the NEIL program has looked at three million images. As a result it has managed to identify 1,500 objects in half a million images and 1,200 scenes in hundreds of thousands of images as well as making 2,500 associations.
The team working on the project hopes that NEIL will learn relationships between different items without being taught.
Computer programs can already identify and label objects using computer vision, which models what humans can see using hardware and software, but the researchers hope that NEIL can bring extra analysis to the data.
""Images are the best way to learn visual properties,"" said Abhinav Gupta, assistant research professor in Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Institute.
""[They] also include a lot of common sense information about the world. People learn this by themselves and, with NEIL, we hope that computers will do so as well.""
Examples of the links that NEIL has made include the facts that cars are found on roads and that ducks can resemble geese.
The program can also make mistakes, say the research team. It may think that the search term ""pink"" relates to the pop star rather than the colour because an image search would be more likely to return this result.
To prevent errors like this, humans will still need to be part of the program's learning process, according to Abhinav Shrivastava, a PhD student working on the project.
""People don't always know how or what to teach computers,"" he said. ""But humans are good at telling computers when they are wrong.""
Another reason for NEIL to run is to create the world's largest visual knowledge database where objects, scenes, actions, attributes and contextual relationships can be labelled and catalogued.
""What we have learned in the last five to 10 years of computer vision research is that the more data you have, the better computer vision becomes,"" Mr Gupta said.

548,"A memo, in the name of the first and deputy first ministers, and sent to government departments last week, was passed to the BBC Spotlight programme.
It reveals SIF is currently projected to be £13.1m over budget.
The cost of the funding programme was supposed to be £80m, for projects targeting social need and deprivation.
But the memo says it will now cost £93.1m - a figure one government source predicted could rise further.
In the document Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness say: ""The purpose of this paper is to seek the executive's agreement to increase the budget and delivery period for the Social Investment Fund to allow full delivery of projects.""
SIF was supposed to have been delivered and completed last year. It is now going to be running until 2020.
The proposal to cover the black hole in the SIF accounts and extend the scheme is due to be discussed at a meeting of the full executive.
However, the DUP-Sinn Féin executive is expected to agree to cover the cost.  The memo says the Department of Finance has already said the shortfall will be met from what is called ""existing annual central capital funds"".
Why is SIF going so far over budget?
When SIF was devised in 2011, it was envisaged that the £80m pot of money would be split: £40m for capital projects, new community buildings; £40m for revenue projects, delivering programmes on the ground like employment schemes.
According to the leaked paper, it appears the huge additional financial requirement has been generated largely by unforeseen costs for the capital projects.
Instead of costing £40m, the running total for those capital schemes is over £52m.
The first and deputy first ministers say: ""There continues to be a trend for rising costs in capital projects, with many requiring additional funding upon completion of detailed design and as they move into construction in order to be delivered in full.
""Whilst every effort is being taken to manage project costs, there are factors beyond the department's control which can result in the need for additional funding (eg discovery of asbestos).""
However, critics of the scheme and opposition parties are bound to raise questions about the management of SIF, and the Stormont executive's ability to manage the public purse - at a time when the executive is already under pressure, amid fears the flawed Renewable Heat Incentive scheme could cost taxpayers in the region of £400 million.
SIF has been beset by controversy for several months, beginning with concern that the programme had allocated funding to community organisation Charter NI which the PSNI has confirmed it believes includes a person or people who have connections with the UDA.
The DUP has been accused of favouring Charter NI and ignoring the UDA link.
However, the party has firmly rejected this. It has highlighted good work that Charter NI does and said if there is any evidence of an illegal nature it must be dealt with by the PSNI.
Charter NI has repeatedly stated that they ""do not condone illegal or criminal activity of any kind"".
Lack of transparency?
Opposition parties at Stormont have also claimed there are issues with SIF around a lack of transparency and tenders for contracts which they claim were not open to fair competition.
Earlier this month, the opposition at Stormont called for an independent inquiry into SIF, but the proposal was blocked on the floor of the assembly by the DUP and Sinn Féin who said the scheme was fully above board.
In a statement to BBC Spotlight, a spokesperson for the Executive Office said SIF has progressed very significantly over the last year and will deliver a total of 68 projects. Forty-two projects worth £54m have commenced and 17 projects worth £27m are already operational.
They also said: ""Now that the full suite of projects to be delivered in each zone is known there is much clearer picture of costs emerging… there are factors beyond the Department's control which can result in the need for additional funding.
""These factors include rising construction costs and unforeseen issues emerging during the detailed design and construction phase - for example: discovery of asbestos.
""Every effort will be made to manage additional costs should they arise and all the necessary policies and procedures are in place and implemented to effectively manage and account for funding and these will be ongoing throughout the duration of the projects.""","The Social Investment Fund (SIF) is currently projected to be £13.1m over budget, with the cost of the funding programme now estimated at £93.1m, instead of the original £80m.

550,"It is critical of MI6's collection and presentation of its sources; of the analysis by the wider intelligence community; of the way the Joint Intelligence Committee allowed its material to be used and of the way in which politicians talked about  intelligence to the public.
The story of one particular MI6 agent, as told in the inquiry report, reveals much of what went wrong.
On 11 September 2002, MI6 reported it was on the edge of a ""significant breakthrough"". It had a new source inside Iraq with ""'phenomenal access"" which might be the ""key to unlock"" Iraqi's biological and chemical weapons programme.
The new source said Iraq had accelerated production of its chemical and biological weapons and built further facilities. And the promise was of more intelligence to come. The head of MI6, Sir Richard Dearlove, was confident he had the access and that in a few weeks the source would produce a ""CD with everything in it"".
The dossier on weapons of mass destruction was being drawn up and word had gone out to MI6's agents to deliver. It seemed like they had.
The reporting was used to provide assurance in drawing up the dossier that its judgements were right and that Iraq did have the weapons. It was also shown directly to the prime minister whose statement in the foreword to the dossier was that the intelligence was ""beyond doubt"".
The new reporting was never shown though to the technical experts at the Defence Intelligence Staff who expressed some doubts about the overall language in drafts of the dossier.
""Sir Richard Dearlove's personal intervention, and its urgency, gave added weight to a report that had not been properly evaluated and would have coloured the perception of ministers and senior officials. The report should have been treated with caution,"" the inquiry notes.
One officer from MI6 - known officially as the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) - asked about confidence attached to the reports said it was thanks to ""wishful thinking. We marketed that intelligenceâ€¦ before it was fully validated"".
By 2 February 2003, the new source had failed to produce the goods. And by 18 February, the source was being described in MI6 notes as having been lying over a period of time.
On 17 February 2003, Dearlove sent messages to MI6's best sources in Iraq ""emphasising the utmost importance of a major find in the next two weeks, and asking them to do everything possible to try and identify where materials are being hidden"".
But MI6 ""did not inform No 10 or others that the source who had provided the reporting issued on 11 and 23 September 2002, about production of chemical and biological agent, had been lying to SIS"".
Amazingly, reports from the agent were still reissued in April - an MI6 officer failed to tell the Chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee, John Scarlett, that the source was apparently lying and said there was no reason to dismiss his information.
And it turns out that even from September, some had concerns that the source had been watching too many movies.
The new source from September had described ""spherical containers"" filled with chemical warfare agents. MI6 in April acknowledged it had not been able to ""verify fully"" the details, but said it had ""no reason to dismiss the bulk of this material"".
However, MI6 also drew attention to the fact the source's description of the device and its spherical glass contents was ""remarkably similar to the fictional chemical weapon portrayed in the film The Rock"".
It even acknowledged that the similarity had been pointed out by one recipient when a report from the agent had been circulated.
In June 2003, MI6 finally met the agent. He had been involved in Iraq's chemical weapons pre-1991 and had been involved in destruction activities. He denied providing any of the material attributed to him. MI6 ""concluded that its source was a fabricator who had lied from the outset"".
In July 2003, the reports were officially withdrawn. ""The withdrawal of the reporting was done in a very low key manner compared with the way in which the original intelligence was issued,"" the inquiry notes.
It was not clear why it was not drawn to some ministers' attention even when giving evidence to the Hutton inquiry into the death of Dr David Kelly. Tony Blair and then Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon only became aware during the later Butler Inquiry.
So when Tony Blair gave evidence to Hutton, he was under impression that the validation was still going on - he hadn't been told it had been withdrawn.
This was described by an MI6 officer as a ""skid-up"".
Similar problems also came to light in withdrawing the intelligence on Iraq being able to fire weapons of mass destruction in 45 minutes - when MI6 say there might be problems after the war, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw says their description of this as a ""snag"" was a ""very major understatement"".
The story of the ""new source"" of September reveals just how much reliance was placed on faulty intelligence. ""Here was a chap who promised the crock of gold at the end of the rainbow,"" one MI6 officer told the inquiry.
Yet all he had done was, it seems, watch a Hollywood movie.","The document is critical of MI6's collection and presentation of sources, analysis by the wider intelligence community, and the way the Joint Intelligence Committee allowed its material to be used.

553,"Boost Juice Bars was founded by Janine Allis, an energetic mother-of-four, who opened her first outlet in Adelaide back in 2000.
Today the company's empire stretches across 400 stores in 13 countries, with global sales of more than 300m Australian dollars ($230m; Â£146m).
Not bad for a self-confessed ""control-freak"" from Melbourne who left school at 16.
As a teenager, Janine's ambitions lay far beyond the suburbs of Australia's second-biggest city.  Instead of wanting to go to university, she juggled three jobs to pay for an overseas adventure that would harden her to the battles she would later have in business.
It was 1984, and she announced to her family that she was heading abroad for a few weeks to follow the well-worn backpacker trail.
Janine's global travels ultimately led to her spending two years being a stewardess behind the bar on David Bowie's private yacht, mixing with the late Princess Margaret and a bevy of celebrities, including Robin Williams.
She was to return to Australia as a young mum with a two-year old child, almost seven years after she had left the country on her travels.
""What travelling taught me was great tenacity, and to think on my feet,"" Janine explains at her firm's headquarters in Melbourne.
""When I worked for Bowie it taught me that there are good and bad people whether they are rich, poor, famous, or the local farmer. So it was a really good insight into humans when you travel.""
Other jobs came and went, including being a publicist for a movie company, and an unsuccessful venture into publishing, which she describes as ""a mug's game"".
Janine also toured Australia with comedians, but that had the unfortunate punch line of not making any money.
It was in the late 1990s that the seed for her global juice enterprise was sown.
Inspired by her time mixing with the rich and famous, Janine says she decided that she ""didn't want to work for anyone"". Instead she wanted to be her own boss, and to ""control my own destiny"", to try to make something special from her life.
And on an immediately practical note, she was on maternity leave for her third child at the time, and thought that being her own boss would give her greater flexibility.
Inspiration for what the business would actually sell came from a trip to the US, and a desire to do something healthy.
She says: ""So I was in America, and I saw the category of the juice and smoothies was just starting to hit its stride.
""And coming back to Australia there was nothing that was healthy, and the increase in obesity was absolutely in line with the fast food increases.
""So I thought wouldn't it be great.  Wouldn't it be great if I could create a product that could make being healthy easy?
""And so with my zero business experience, other than being a nanny and a stewardess on a boat, that didn't really help, I wrote the business plan and off I went.""
A new century saw the first Juice Boost bar open in March 2000. Janine chose to open it in Adelaide rather than Melbourne because she determined that it would be easier to see if the concept worked if she tried it first in a smaller marketplace.
Backed by bank loans, and Janine and her husband Jeff - who also helps to run the business - putting their house forward as collateral, within four years the company was operating in every Australian state and boasted 100 outlets.
It was, by any measure, a rapid expansion, and there was more to follow.  A study trip to Washington DC to learn about the rewards and hazards of doing business overseas resulted in the firm's first foreign branch in Chile, which opened in 2006.
Others followed, including at the Trafford Centre in Manchester, England.
Promoting itself as ""a healthy alternative to fast food"", Boost Juice Bars now has stores in China, India, Germany and South Africa.
Recalling those fast-moving years in the early 2000s, Janine has admitted that her creation did balloon far too quickly.
The mistakes, she explained, were ""all self-inflicted"".  The company had grown too fast, didn't have sufficient infrastructure and, for a while, the customer was neglected.
But, like an errant child, the firm was brought back into line, and part of Janine's success is a maternal attitude to work.
""Often I look at my business as a child.  When you first start a business it is at the incubator stage, it needs you 100%,"" she says.
Her children are today aged 24, 18, 16 and six, but Janine concedes that there were often times when the pursuit of profit trumped family life.
""You've got this beast which is the business that is completely sucking your time and energy, and people go 'I want life balance', but to make a successful business you have to give your soul to it.""
Finally, after 16 years she has the balance she has craved between being a mother and a self-made multimillionaire, yet the urge to expand remains.
Today Janine's umbrella company Retail Zoo is backed by a number of private equity firms.
Its other businesses include Mexican-style restaurant chain Salsa's Fresh Mex Grill, which has 54 outlets in Australia, and coffee shop business Cibo Espresso.
She says: ""Businesses are either doing one of two things; they are going up or down.  They are not staying the same, so our job is to find growth.""
When not doing the day job, Janine has become a business mentor, and is a familiar face to viewers of Australian TV show Shark Tank, which is the country's version of business pitching programme Dragons' Den.
She puts her success down to one primal emotion.
""The number one thing that motivated me going through my business career was fear,"" she says.  ""[At one point] we had liabilities of more than 20 million Australian dollars, and so we actually sold our family home to put all of our money into the business.
""So there was no plan B, which in some respects helps because it gets too hard.  It is like climbing Everest... you had to keep going to the top.""

He said it was a scene of ""total devastation"".
More than 700 were injured and hospitals are struggling to cope.
The first explosion happened at 23:30 local time (15:30 GMT) on Wednesday in an industrial zone home to car factories, aircraft assembly lines and other manufacturing and research firms.
Mr Keld said: ""My wife and I felt several shockwaves. We thought it was initially thunder then a much stronger one blew several of our windows open.

Meanwhile, papers support the decision to fine consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble for ""false advertising"".
Regulators said P&G overstated the effects of its Crest toothpaste in a TV ad featuring a popular Taiwanese talk show host.
The Beijing News agrees that harsh punishment is a way to stop firms providing ""misleading"" information to consumers.
""It is not enough for the regulators to hand out a record-high fine to put an end to these untruthful advertisements. Consumers hurt by such information can also seek damages through lawsuits,"" suggests the article.
An article in the Beijing Times adds that celebrities who appear in such advertisements should be punished too.
A commentary in the Beijing Youth Daily, however, points to the problems in the current law and calls for a review of the regulations.
The current regulation states that advertisers who mislead can be fined up to five times what they spend on the advert, the article notes.
""We can only say that P&G's advertising fee was very high and that led to a higher fine,"" says the article, worrying that the law is not likely to deter firms with a much lower advertising budget.
And finally, papers discuss the official retirement age for workers as authorities debate policy changes.

Government departments are working on the draft law this year and will seek public feedback next year before publishing it in 2017, the report says.
The current policy states that the retirement age for men is 60, while women retire at 50 or 55.
Peng Xizhe, dean of the School of Social Development and Public Policy at Fudan University, suggests having a uniform retirement age for both genders and ""then progressively raise the age in some professions"".

566,"Lindsey Kushner QC said women were entitled to ""drink themselves into the ground"" but their ""disinhibited behaviour"" could put them in danger.
Judge Kushner made the courtroom plea as she jailed a man for six years who raped a girl he met in a Burger King in Manchester city centre last year.
But, Rape Crisis slammed her comments as ""outrageous"" and ""misguided"".
Yvonne Traynor, chief executive of Rape Crisis South East, said: ""As a judge and a woman she should know better.
""The only person who is responsible for rape, is the rapist.
""Women are yet again being blamed for rape.""
The judge spoke out as she retired from the criminal bench.
Judge Kushner, 64, said ""as a woman judge"" it would ""be remiss"" if she did not beg women to protect themselves from predatory men who ''gravitate'' towards drunken females.
The mother of two, who has sat as a senior circuit judge since 2002, said judges have been criticised for ""putting more emphasis on what girls should and shouldn't do than on the act and the blame to be apportioned to rapists"".
""There is absolutely no excuse and a woman can do with her body what she wants and a man will have to adjust his behaviour accordingly,"" she said.
But she said she does not ""think it's wrong for a judge to beg woman to take actions to protect themselves"".
Judge Kushner's plea to women to protect themselves was strongly - but carefully - worded: she was emphatically not blaming them for an attack but warning them that when drunk they're more vulnerable.
Other judges who've stepped into this tricky territory haven't always framed their remarks so delicately.
Judge Mary Jane Mowat's comment in 2014 that ""the rape conviction statistics will not improve until women stop getting so drunk"" was designed to highlight a point Judge Kushner also made - that victims are less likely to believed if they've had a lot of alcohol - but she made it sound as though women were responsible for rapists getting off.
But even more insensitive was the comment made by Mr Justice Leonard in 1987 when he declared that the trauma suffered by Ealing vicarage rape victim Jill Saward ""had not been so great"".  He later apologised.
Judge Kushner said ""potential defendants to rape"" target girls who have been drinking because they are ""more likely to agree as they are more disinhibited, even if they don't agree they are less likely to fight a man with evil intentions off"".
She said a woman would be less likely to report a rape ""because she was drunk or cannot remember what happened or feels ashamed to deal with it"".
""Or, if push comes to shove, a girl who has been drunk is less likely to be believed than one who is sober at the time,"" she said.
""It should not be like that but it does happen and we see it time and time again.""
She said women ""are entitled to do what they like"" but asked them to ""please be aware there are men out there who gravitate towards a woman who might be more vulnerable than others"".
""That's my final line, in my final criminal trial, and my final sentence,"" she concluded.
Judge Kushner jailed factory worker Ricardo Rodrigues-Fortes-Gomes, 19, after Manchester Crown Court heard he ignored his 18-year-old victim's screams as he attacked her on a canal bank.

Mr Puzder, chief executive of CKE Restaurants, which operates the Carl's Jr and Hardee's, has often argued a higher minimum wage would kill jobs.
The Labor Department regulates wages along with workplace safety.
Mr Puzder has criticised a new Labor Department rule aimed at extending overtime pay to more than four million US workers.
He has also dismissed a nationwide campaign by fast-food workers for a $15 minimum wage, more than double the current federal level.

Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO union, said Mr Puzder's ""business record is defined by fighting against working people"".
Mr Puzder was one of Mr Trump's earliest campaign financiers, contributing more than $330,000 to his White House bid, reports the Washington Post.
He opposes the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, claiming it has left working families with less money to spend dining out, spawning a ""restaurant recession"".
Mr Puzder has brushed off allegations that his fast-food restaurants' racy commercials - featuring scantily clad models gorging on burgers - are sexist.

Secretary of State John Kerry said US commitment to Japan's defence was ""ironclad"", including disputed islands.
Japan's pacifist constitution currently allows only for self-defence, but Mr Abe has called for a re-interpretation.
Any change is likely to seriously alarm Japan's East Asian neighbours.
Mr Abe was set to visit the site of the 2013 Boston marathon bombing on Monday before travelling to Washington ahead of talks on Tuesday with President Barack Obama.
The changes were announced in New York by Mr Kerry and Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida.

The al-Yarmouk camp houses Palestinians and also Syrians displaced by fighting.
Opposition activists say those killed had been sheltering in a mosque as fighting raged in the surrounding area.
A video posted online, which cannot be verified, showed several dead bodies apparently sprawled in the street and on the steps of the mosque.
The observatory said the attack on Yarmouk was the sixth on Sunday on districts of southern Damascus where rebels have been battling government forces.
Information from opposition activist groups cannot be independently verified.
Violence has been increasing in and around the capital in recent weeks.
Yarmouk is the largest Palestinian refugee camp in Syria.
There are some 500,000 Palestinians in Syria. Their loyalties are divided between the government and the opposition.
In August, at least 20 people were killed in a shopping area during a mortar attack on the camp.
In another development, an Islamist rebel group said it had captured a military installation near the war-torn northern city of Aleppo.
A statement from the Tawheed Brigade said it had ""fully liberated"" the site and taken ""at least 100"" prisoners.
It added that the brigade's commander had been killed in the battle.
Unconfirmed reports identified the complex as the Hanano Barracks, north-east of the city. Rebels previously seized the barracks in September but were driven out by government troops a few days later.
The site includes an army base, a recruiting centre and a military school.
If confirmed, the loss of the base would be the latest in a series of setbacks for government forces in and around Aleppo.
Earlier this month, rebel fighters captured another large military base west of the city.
Base 111 at Sheikh Suleiman was said to have been captured by jihadists led by the militant al-Nusra Front.
In November, rebels captured another large base nearby at Atarib.
In Aleppo itself, rebels are believed to be still in control of at least half the city, despite attempts by government forces to dislodge them.

Serious presidential candidates seem obligated to make a trip abroad to prove their foreign policy mettle, but when it comes to such overseas adventures, boring is pretty close to a best-case outcome.
Some might recall the sunny day seven years ago, when then-Senator Barack Obama delivered an address in Berlin to an adoring crowd numbering in the hundreds of thousands. More often, however, candidates don't soar on foreign soil, they stumble.
Within the past year Governors Scott Walker, Chris Christie and Bobby Jindal have all wilted under the harsh spotlight of the world stage. And then there was Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney's ill-fated 2012 trip to Europe, where he generated numerous negative headlines, including ruffling British feathers when he wondered if London was prepared to host that summer's Olympic Games.
It's the kind of stuff that gives campaign hands nightmares - particularly the small group of experts and academics who are tasked with educating and counselling presidential candidates on international affairs.
Eliot Cohen, a professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University, advised Mr Romney on foreign policy in 2012. He says the campaign made the mistake of bringing only a ""very tight personal staff"" to Europe with the former Massachusetts governor.
""It's very hard not to stumble,"" he says. Aside from incumbent presidents running for re-election, candidates have little in the way of international affairs support staff. Campaign organisations are mostly composed of political operatives and domestic policy experts, and full-time foreign policy advisors tend to be far fewer in number and often with less experience.
Although campaigns bring in outside advisors - releasing lists of names with some fanfare - he says the amount of time they get on a candidate's schedule is limited.
""If you don't have that kind of massive staff working for you, it's so easy to walk into some kind of bog - people just sink in without a trace,"" Cohen says.
""What I would have advised on that particular trip is just say nice things about the Olympics, that's all,"" he adds. ""It was an unforced error.""
According to veteran foreign policy hands who've joined the political fray to help prospective commanders-in-chief, avoiding such unforced errors on foreign policy - as well as developing an overarching international vision - are the primary goals when they sit down with their charges.
Former US Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton says that ""almost every candidate needs to know more about national security"".
""The real issue is whether their background, their combination of interest, experience and involvement, gives them an opportunity to exercise an informed judgement,"" he continues. ""Ultimately the most important thing a president needs is not facts, but judgement.""
Mr Bolton, who flirted with his own presidential bid this year, has worked with numerous Republican candidates, including Mr Romney in 2012. His name has been linked to Mr Jindal's campaign, and in February he was overheard having foreign policy discussions over dinner with Texas Senator Ted Cruz.
""Some have specific questions that they want to talk about,"" Bolton says of the candidates he advises. ""Others just kind of want to go around the world and so on. Some have specific questions about how a president makes decisions, who they want to talk to and how it works.""
The current crop of presidential hopefuls offers a wide range of levels of foreign policy interest and experience. On one end are candidates like Democrat Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state, and Republican Lindsey Graham, a veteran of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
Others, like Mr Walker of Wisconsin, have little foreign policy experience. He was roundly criticised earlier this year, for instance, when responded to a question about how he'd deal with the Islamic State by comparing it to his confrontations with the public employee unions in his home state.
According to Michael O'Hanlon, a Brookings institution senior fellow who advised Mrs Clinton during her 2008 presidential campaign, good foreign policy aides need to tailor their approach to the particular candidate's experience - and also their personality.
""Some people are going to welcome more assertive advice than others,"" he says. ""It's one thing if you've known the candidate for 20 years. It's something else if you're trying to get to know them through this process. If you want to do the latter, then you've got to interact at the pace and the level that they're comfortable with.""
When the candidate has a solid resume in international affairs - like George HW Bush in 1988, for instance - an advisor may just be honoured to be invited into the room.
""It's not so much of an educational process as it is a team where maybe one person is following an issue in more detail, but the candidate ultimately has pretty good confidence and judgement and even quite a bit of knowledge about the issue at hand,"" he says.
In other cases, advisers have to provide a more in-depth education - ""fill in the scaffolding and figure out how to handle a lot of other issues and just develop some talking points"", he says. At the very least the goal is to prevent a candidate from getting blindsided in debates or from reporters springing unexpected 'pop quizzes' - as a Boston reporter did of then-candidate George W Bush in 1999.
And then there are the times when ""foreign policy advisers"" don't really do all that much advising, O'Hanlon says.
Campaigns release a list of names on their foreign policy team, but those individuals may never get any time with the candidate. Instead, they're brought on board to satisfy particular political constituencies.
""Sometimes the campaigns get built up and the advisors get recruited just to keep them feeling part of the team,"" he says. ""You don't want people to feel dissed or unwanted. So if there's a group that is talented and knowledgeable, maybe you just want to have them on standby and not lose them to somebody else.""
Such an approach isn't without risks, of course. Reporters and opponents often pore over the announcements and hints of campaign advisors, looking for an angle for a story or a line to attack.
Jeb Bush, for instance, made it easy on his foes when word leaked that during a private meeting he named his presidential brother as one of his top Middle East advisers.
And Jeb Bush's attempts to distance himself from his brother's controversies took another a hit in May when he included 17 former members of his brother's administration on his list of foreign policy advisers, including outspoken Iraq War architect Paul Wolfowitz.
It's conventional wisdom that, unless there's a war or major international crises, foreign policy usually takes a back seat to domestic concerns during US presidential elections - so candidate stumbles up to this point may eventually fade into the background.
At least thus far, however, international affairs - particularly the Obama administration's handling of Iran, Israel and the Islamic State - have been regular topics of discussion among almost all of the Republican presidential aspirants.
In many ways this is turning out to be a different kind of Republican presidential race - from the level of money pouring in to the sheer number of entrants. And perhaps the campaign will be different in its level of emphasis on foreign policy, as well.
The more the candidates talk about events overseas, the more influence the often-overlooked foreign policy advisors will wield.
""This is what I wanted, this is what I hoped for, this is what I predicted really,"" Bolton says of the candidates' new-found emphasis on world events.
""If people want to talk, I'm delighted to talk with them,"" he says, in what could be a foreign policy adviser's credo.

David Cameron has been accused of ""cronyism"" after the appointment of 45 new peers, which include 26 former Tory ministers and aides.

A number of the MPs who have chosen to accept the new positions have previously campaigned for the Lords to be reformed. They say they will now fight for change from within the unelected chamber.
Full list of new peers and other honours
Analysis: Does size matter?
Lord Norton and Baroness Deech told BBC Radio 4's Today programme they would like to see the House of Lords have fewer members than the House of Commons, which has 650 MPs.
Baroness Deech said it was becoming increasingly difficult to get work done because of ""too many people trying to be heard"".
""The place is simply overcrowded to an extent that you can't do your job properly,"" she said.
""You have to queue for two hours to be able to get an oral question tabled.""
Lord Norton said the Lords was looking at a number of options to reduce its size, such as having a retirement age limit, but also needed to consider how members are appointed.
Both peers called for a statutory appointments commission to be set up to approve nominations.
Baroness Deech said this would ensure ""no more donors and bag carriers"" are appointed as it ""doesn't look good"".
She added that recent scandals - such as the resignation of Lord Sewell following allegations of drug taking - were ""putting a nail in the coffin of our respectability, if not our durability"".
The SNP has branded the 45 new peers as ""a sorry list of rejected politicians, cronies and hangers-on with big chequebooks"".
Former Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Menzies Campbell, who has fought for Lords reform, said he was taking up his Lords seat so he could argue his case from within the House.

Co-defendant Nathan White, 28, of Maesteg, denies assault occasioning actual bodily harm and common assault against another prisoner.
The alleged offences happened during an operation in which nine officers carrying shields entered the prison yard to remove Hastie-Davies and two others who had refused to come back inside.
Mr Potts told Newport Crown Court he started working at the prison as a health care assistant before becoming a prison officer.
He said he was immediately assigned to a high-risk unit for prisoners at risk of self-harm, despite most officers requiring two years' experience ""on the landings"" before working in such an area.
He was then moved to the Phoenix Unit, for prisoners who had caused trouble.

He said: ""I thought I had a good relationship with prisoners, obviously I did not get on with everyone like out in the community.
""We would work out the issues and get them back up to the wings as quick as possible.""
He told the jury there should have been four officers on duty on the unit, but on the day of the alleged offences, there was only three.
When he reported it, he was told to ""manage as best we could"".
He said he was with Hastie-Davies and two other inmates on the exercise yard when he heard a ""fire indication"" on his radio.
He said it was not ideal to leave prisoners on the yard but added: ""If the fire wasn't on my wing I would not have responded. I was the only member of the team with a working radio that day.""
While dealing with the fire, which another inmate started in his cell, he said he became aware the three prisoners on the yard were refusing to come in.
He said he was told by a senior manager to get his control and restraint kit and, as far as he knew, this was a ""proper tornado shout"", meaning all other avenues of clearing the yard had failed.

Millions of people are expected to visit the Biennale over six months.
Mr Fagan's collection of sculptures, drawings and audio-visual installations was put together in Arbroath.
The university lecturer and contemporary artist was chosen to represent the ""Scotland + Venice"" partnership, a linkup between Creative Scotland, the National Galleries of Scotland and the British Council Scotland, which has been contributing to the Venice Biennale for seven years.
Mr Fagen, who teaches PhD, Masters and final-year honours students at the Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design, has previously taken part in the group's representation in Venice, but this is his first solo exhibition there.
His specially-created body of work, commissioned and curated by Hospitalfield House in Arbroath, is being exhibited at Palazzo Fontana, a Venetian palace off the Grand Canal in the Cannaregio district of Venice.
The complex collection involves a number of collaborations, including work with composer Sally Beamish, the musicians of the Scottish Ensemble, and reggae singer Ghetto Priest.
Mr Fagen said: ""The Venice Biennale offers an exciting platform to showcase my work in a truly international context.
""I am honoured to have been recognised and chosen by the Scotland + Venice partnership to participate in Scotland's presentation at this year's Biennale.
""Having their support has enabled me to work collaboratively with the renowned composer Sally Beamish and to rekindle my long term collaborations with producer Adrian Sherwood and the fantastic vocals of Ghetto Priest.""

587,"From the stores that sell fertiliser and pesticides, to the ubiquitous pool halls where ""raspachines"" (field hands who harvest the coca leaves) come to spend their modest earnings on cold beer and fried empanadas, it all comes back to one plant.
Colombia's government wants to change this, as part of the peace deal it reached with the country's left-wing rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) last year. It will not be an easy task.
""Everyone from here who has gone to university has done so because of money from growing coca,"" explains Jon, who has been harvesting the leaf since childhood and is now studying forensic science at a technical institute in Mocoa, Putumayo's capital.
As per the terms of the peace deal, the government has signed up almost 76,000 families to an ambitious campaign to substitute the growing of coca, poppy and marijuana with legal agricultural projects.
Jon's family was one of 500 selected from the communities around the village of La Carmelita to participate in a pilot of the national programme.

Success, in the long term, will depend not only on the viability of the new crops, but on the state's ability to transform its relationship with the marginalised regions where the 50-year armed conflict raged.
""For years, we've made clear that we're committed to leaving coca behind, given certain necessary conditions for our survival,"" said Luz Deify Velázquez Quintero, a community leader in La Carmelita.
""Now it's time to find out if the government is serious.""
This is not the first attempt to wean Putumayo off growing coca.
Under the US-backed Plan Colombia, the authorities attempted to eradicate the plants from the air by spraying them with herbicides.
Hundreds of millions of dollars were also channelled to the country for ""alternative development"" assistance, resources that locals say rarely found their way to Putumayo and the pockets of farmers there.
While the new programme is largely welcomed by La Carmelita's coca growers, distrust of government programmes is an all-too-familiar sentiment.
""Unless there's transparency and a real willingness to involve and empower the communities, what's most likely is that people end up going back to coca,"" warns Yuli Zuluaga, a regional representative of a recently formed national coca-grower's association.
Government officials say they have learned the lessons of Plan Colombia. They think that having former Farc rebels on board will make a big difference.
The rebels financed their armed struggle through ""taxes"" on coca production and therefore had a vested interest in the business flourishing.
But even with a peace process now firmly in place, challenges remain.
In June, participants in the pilot scheme received the first of six bimonthly food subsidies worth 2m Colombian pesos ($665; £500) each.
In exchange, those who received it have promised to take part in a two-month voluntary coca eradication scheme.
But whether the farmers' new projects will be productive will ultimately depend on whether money is invested in Putumayo's poor healthcare, education, and infrastructure, conflict monitoring group Ideas for Peace Foundation concluded in a recent report.
There are no hospitals or drinking water and only little electricity for miles in any direction from La Carmelita.
The only adequately funded public institutions are the military bases built to protect the region's oil pipelines.
""The problem isn't figuring out what to produce,"" explained Jesús Antonio Toro Martínez, president of Agropal, a local farmer's association.
""The problem is that we don't have electricity to store it, we don't have the equipment to process it, and we don't have roads to bring it to market. In other words, we don't have commerce.""
Mr Toro, a local farmer and former ""raspachin"", says that taking plantains the nearest urban centre if Puerto Asís is no easy task.
He says that the costs for transporting bundles on speed boats or local buses known as ""chivas"" can add up to as much as 90% of the final sale value.
In March, the US released figures suggesting that a record 188,000 hectares (1,880 sq km) of land in Colombia had been planted with coca last year, an 18% increase compared with 2015.
The report triggered renewed claims from opponents to the peace process in Colombia and conservatives in Washington that the government's reformist approach has promoted lawlessness.
With pressure mounting and the 2018 national elections looming, President Juan Manuel Santos announced that he intends to eradicate 100,000 hectares by next year, half through substitution, and half through manual eradication.
""We need results, to prove to ourselves, to the country, and to the world that this is the right way forward,"" Miguel Ortega, a government substitution official, told La Carmelita residents.

But Republicans, who control the Senate, argued it stigmatised the disabled and voted it down 57 to 43.
President Donald Trump is set to approve revoking the rule, his first action on guns since taking power.
It passed the House of Representatives last week.
After the Sandy Hook shooting tragedy which killed 20 children and six adults in 2012, President Barack Obama introduced a measure that required the Social Security Administration to report information on people with mental illness to the FBI.
Adam Lanza, the 20-year-old man who went on a shooting rampage at the elementary school, suffered from a variety of impairments including Asperger's syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder.
In an interview with the BBC, Mr Obama said his inability to pass ""meaningful"" gun legislation was his biggest frustration.
Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, who led the repeal effort, said the regulation ""unfairly stigmatises"" people with mental illness and infringes on their constitutional right to bear arms.
Mr Grassley used eating and sleep disorders as examples that could fall under the regulation requiring a more extensive background check.
The regulation, however, does not stipulate that any person with a disability would be affected.
Rather, it focuses on people who are unable to deal with their own finances and require a trustee to administer them.
""If a specific individual is likely to be violent due to the nature of their mental illness, then the government should have to prove it,"" Mr Grassley said.
But Mr Grassley was not alone in criticising the Obama era regulation.

Ray Houghton's looping volley was enough to see off the Azzurri in the 1994 World Cup.
He said Martin O'Neill's men must have the belief they can repeat the feat 22 years on.
The Republic have to win the game after a disappointing 3-0 defeat against Belgium last Saturday.
""You can't change what happened against Belgium,"" he said.
""We have to go out there and attack. Work hard and put them under pressure. Get on the ball and don't be afraid.
""We have to create more and control possession,"" he added. ""Ultimately, it'll come down to two things - our attitude and theirs.""
Italy are already confirmed as group winners and manager Antonio Conte is expected to make up to nine changes for the match against Ireland.
For Houghton, this could be a mixed blessing for the Boys in Green.
""England made six changes on Monday and were flat,"" he said,
""If Italy make nine changes, that's nine new faces that have not played together much or might not gel straight away.
""But, at the same time, Italy play Spain in the next round and, if I was one of those players, I would want to be in that game.
""I'd want to put down a marker to the manager and show him what I can do to get a chance of playing.""
Weather conditions at Lille's Stade Pierre-Mauroy have been less than ideal and Uefa have said the pitch has been ""irreversibly damaged"" by rain.
A far cry from 1994 when Ray Houghton and his teammates took on a world-class Italian side in the heat of Giants Stadium, New York.
""It was a very warm day, the weather was quite hot and it didn't suit the Irish fans too much,"" recalled Houghton, who won 73 caps for the Republic.
""I'd done a lot of training and used a sauna a lot in the lead up, so I didn't find it too much of a problem.
""I'd played in Singapore before and that heat burned the back of your throat. In New York, it didn't bother me too much.""
Apart from the challenge of the heat, Ireland also faced an Italy team that were among the favourites to win the tournament and featured stars such as Franco Baresi, Paolo Maldini and Roberto Baggio.
""We knew it would be a big game,"" said Houghton. ""We played Italy in the 1990 World Cup four years earlier and, if you look through their team from that day, there wasn't many who were still playing in 1994.
""If you looked at our team that day a huge percentage of players were still playing in 1994. Italy have always been a great tournament team.""
Despite those odds, it took just 11 minutes for the Republic to take the lead with a goal that has since become immortalised in Irish football history.
""It was a long punt up the field. Baresi got his head on it, but it wasn't a great header,"" said Houghton.

""I discussed many ideas but not at this part of the year,"" Alonso said. ""We feel so much more positive than before with the recent pace of the car. It is something we didn't discuss for four or five months already.
""My intention is to race and I think I will race.""
Former F1 driver Mark Webber, who is close to Alonso, said he believed the 34-year-old would make a final decision after trying the 2016 McLaren in pre-season testing next February.
""I think he is a ticking bomb,"" Webber said. ""I think give him two or three days in the car and if the car is uncompetitive I think he'll have a year off.""
But Alonso said that it would be ""impossible to know how the season will go"" after one test, adding: ""If we are second or ninth, it will not change my approach or my intention to keep winning that season.""
The Spaniard said after the Japanese Grand Prix in September that he ""didn't know"" whether he would race at McLaren next year.
Later that day, he put out a series of tweets reaffirming his commitment to McLaren, saying: ""No-one should have any doubt that I have three years with McLaren and my career in F1 will end with this team, hopefully winning everything.""
Nevertheless, insiders have continued to express doubts about whether Alonso, who left Ferrari for McLaren at the end of last season because he believed they would give him a better chance of winning a third world title, could face another season at the back of the grid.

There have been suggestions since Japan that if the Honda engine remains uncompetitive in 2016, Alonso could take a year out and come back to fulfil the final two years of his contract in 2017 and 2018.
Although he and team-mate Jenson Button have generally remained positive and optimistic in their public utterances in 2015, their frustrations have occasionally surfaced.
Dennis said he believed McLaren and Honda would be more competitive in 2016.
He told a news conference at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Saturday: ""We have a great number of driver options. We have two of the best drivers in the world in our cars.
""When we have to take the decision, we will take it together and at this moment in time our drivers of next year are Fernando and Jenson Button.""
He added that Alonso ""will definitely finish his career in McLaren"".
Dennis said: ""We have quite a lot of confidence in where we will be at the beginning of next season. It is most definitely going in the right direction.
""We are going up a painful curve, but up it we will go and we will get there.""
McLaren will almost certainly finish ninth of 10 teams in the championship this season, meaning their garage will be moved to the far end of the pit lane.
Dennis said: ""I know where the motorhome will be but I don't think the car will be matching that position.""

596,"The Institute for Fiscal Studies said George Osborne may have to find another £11bn from tax rises or spending cuts if the economy does not pick up.
This is on top of £8bn of cuts already mooted in the Budget.
Mr Osborne will deliver his Autumn Statement on 5 December.
The IFS warned that the statement could bring ""more fiscal pain"".
A spokesperson for the Treasury said that the independent Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) would make its economic forecast next week alongside the Autumn Statement.
The think tank's latest analysis takes account of ""the now weaker outlook for the UK economy"" and ""the disappointing trend in tax revenues seen over the last seven months"".
Figures last week showed the government borrowed more than expected in October with a fall in corporation tax receipts contributing to the rise.
The IFS said if borrowing continued at the same pace for the rest of the year, the government would miss its borrowing target by £13bn.
It sets out two scenarios for the economy:
It said that under the first scenario, ""no further action above that already planned"" would be needed for the chancellor to meet his fiscal mandate of balancing the budget by the end of a rolling five-year period, though he has already discussed the possibility of welfare cuts of £8bn over the two years from 2015-16 to 2016-17.
But under the second scenario, to meet that mandate would require extending the squeeze on public spending to 2017-18 and implementing a further £11bn of tax increases or welfare cuts, on top of the £8bn.
The Treasury spokesperson said: ""Action taken by the government has cut the deficit by a quarter, whilst over a million new jobs have been created in the private sector, inflation is down, and the economy is healing.
""Britain still faces economic challenges at home and abroad but the government is taking the tough decisions needed to deal with our debts and equip our economy for the global race.
The IFS also said that Mr Osborne may have to abandon his other fiscal target - that debt should be falling as a share of GDP in 2015-16.
However, the governor of the Bank of England, Sir Mervyn King, has said that missing the debt target would be acceptable ""if it's because the world economy has grown slowly and so we, in turn, have grown slowly"".
Economists at Goldman Sachs have also suggested that missing the debt target would not necessarily result in the UK losing credibility or its AAA sovereign rating.
Carl Emmerson, deputy director of the IFS, said: ""Since the Budget, the outlook for the UK economy has deteriorated and government receipts have disappointed by even more than this year's weak growth would normally suggest.
""As a result, the chancellor might find himself having to abandon one of his fiscal targets.
""If much of the additional weakness this year feeds into a permanently higher outlook for borrowing, then in order to comply with his other fiscal target Mr Osborne would need to announce yet more tax rises or spending cuts for the next parliament in next week's Autumn Statement.
""In that case the planned era of austerity could run for eight years - from 2010-11 to 2017-18.""
He told the BBC: ""If we do have a permanently worse outlook for borrowing, it would be sensible to announce now, measures for future implementation - not more pain now but more pain in future years to get that deficit down.""
Chris Leslie, Labour's shadow Treasury minister, said Mr Osborne should use his Autumn Statement next week to ""finally set out a plan to create the jobs and growth which are vital to get the deficit down"".
""He must rethink his plan to give millionaires a tax cut next year while forcing millions of families and pensioners to pay more. People on low and middle incomes should not be paying the price for this government's economic failure.""
TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said the IFS's analysis showed that the chancellor's economic strategy was ""failing on all counts"" and that he should ""change course"".
""Sadly (Mr Osborne) looks set to drive the economy even faster in the wrong direction,"" he said.","The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has warned that George Osborne may need to find another £11bn in tax rises or spending cuts if the economy does not pick up.

601,"The rise in regulated fares, including season tickets, is capped at no more than July's RPI inflation rate of 1%.
However, unregulated fares, such as off-peak leisure tickets, can go up by as much as train companies like.
It is the smallest rise in six years, but campaigners said some passengers would be ""amazed"" by any rise because of the ""dire"" quality of some services.
Punctuality figures published by Network Rail show more than one in 10 trains (10.7%) arrived at their final destination at least five minutes late in the past 12 months.
Anthony Smith, from independent watchdog Transport Focus, said passengers were ""paying their part"" and it was now time for the rail industry to deliver on the basics.
Bruce Williamson, of campaign group Railfuture, claimed fares were ""increasingly divorced from reality"".
""High street prices have remained stagnant for more than a year, with the official CPI inflation figure hovering around zero, yet the government thinks it's fair to make rail travel even more expensive,"" he said.
Under government rules, the rise in regulated fares was restricted to no more than the Retail Prices Index measure of inflation over the year to July, which was 1%.
Over the long term, RPI has tended to record higher inflation than the other measure of rising prices, the Consumer Price Index, which was 0.1% during the year.
The increases, which were announced in December, cover fares in England, Scotland and Wales. Northern Ireland is treated separately.
Commuters with annual season tickets can find out how much their fare has gone up by on the National Rail Enquiries website.
A 12-month pass from Basingstoke to London will cost £4,196 in 2016, up by £40 from £4,156.
Workers travelling from Gloucester to Birmingham will have to pay out £36 more than the 2015 price of £3,860 for a ticket.
Passengers making daily journeys between Liverpool and Manchester will see their season tickets rise by £28, up from £2,960 to £2,988.
Paul Plummer, of the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) which represents train operators and Network Rail, said on average 97p in every pound from fares was spent on trains, staff and other running costs.
""We know that nobody likes to pay more to travel by train, especially to get to work, and at 1.1% this is the smallest average increase in fares for six years.""
Labour said commuters would be paying on average 25% more for rail season tickets since David Cameron took office.
Some were paying a ""truly staggering"" rise of almost £2,000 in cash terms since 2010, shadow transport secretary Lilian Greenwood said.
The analysis compared costs on over 200 routes between when the Conservatives came to power and the new prices for 2016.
The highest increase found was on a Virgin Trains season ticket between Birmingham and London Euston which  has risen by £1,984 and now costs more than £10,000 for the first time.
Action for Rail - a campaign by rail unions and the TUC - said privatisation of the railways was to blame.

Meanwhile police in Munich have announced the arrest of a 16-year-old Aghan friend of the attacker.
They say he is under investigation for not reporting Sonboly's plans.
A statement on Munich police's Facebook page says: ""There is a suspicion that the 16-year-old is a possible tacit accomplice to the attack.""
The statement goes on to say that the youth reported to police immediately after the shooting on Friday, and was interviewed as somebody with a connection to the attacker.
But in the course of the interviews, they discovered discrepancies in his statements.
They say they are now investigating him on suspicion of failing to report a planned crime.
The investigations will have to show to what extent he was responsible for a Facebook post inviting people to meet at a cinema complex near the main railway station in Munich.
The attacker himself had put up a Facebook post before his attack, inviting people to come to the fast food restaurant where the shooting began.
Seven of the dead in Friday's shooting at the Olympia shopping centre were were teenagers - two Turks, two Germans, a Hungarian, a Greek and a Kosovan.
A further 35 people were injured, but only four of them have bullet wounds - many were hurt while fleeing the scene.
The state government officials told a news conference that the victims of the attack had not been specifically targeted and were not classmates of the gunman.
Also they did not include three youths allegedly involved in bullying Sonboly when he was at school.
Robert Heimberger, head of Bavaria's criminal police, said the gunman had been planning the attack since he paid a visit last year to the town of Winnenden - the scene of a previous school shooting in 2009 - and took photographs.
He said it was likely the Glock pistol - which had been reactivated - was bought on the ""dark net"" market, an area accessible only with the use of special software. It had been a theatre prop.
Sonboly was said to be a keen player of ""first-person shooter"" video games.
Mr Heimberger added that the parents of the gunman remained in shock and were not able to be interviewed.
He also said police had not found the manifesto of Norwegian mass killer Anders Behring Breivik when they searched the gunman's room at his parents' flat.
A day earlier, officials had raised the possibility of a link to Breivik, whose own attack was carried out five years earlier to the day.
As to Sonboly's state of mind, a spokesman for the Munich prosecutors' office told the news conference that the gunman had spent two months as an inpatient at a mental care facility in 2015 and was afterwards treated as an outpatient.

However, there was no evidence of any political motivation.

The attacker had been planning the attack since he visited the town of Winnenden in 2009 and took photographs. The Glock pistol, which had been reactivated, was likely bought on the dark net. The parents of the gunman remain in shock and were not able to be interviewed. The attack was not politically motivated, and there was no evidence of any link to Norwegian mass killer Anders Behring Breivik. Senior German politicians have called for tighter controls on the sale of guns in the wake of the shooting.

611,"And they suggest that cutting down on sugar-sweetened beverages could make a dent in the number of people developing diabetes in the UK.
Other experts, however, warn that being overweight and inactive are likely to play a stronger role in the disease.
The study appears in the British Medical Journal.
Scientists have warned of a link between obesity, sugar-sweetened drinks and diabetes for some time.
But few studies have unpicked whether people who consume lots of sugary drinks are more likely to develop diabetes, regardless of their weight.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge analysed 17 studies in this area.
And the pattern they found hints that drinks with added sugar could be linked to an increased risk of diabetes, regardless of weight.
Dr Fumiaki Imamura, a lead researcher, told the BBC: ""Our study suggests that if everyone reduces soft sugary drinks, everyone gets the benefit.""
But he acknowledges there are limitations to this research.
For example, the study did not account for changes in people's drinking habits or lifestyle over the years.
And their calculations are based on an assumption that the drinks directly lead to diabetes - but a direct link is yet to be proven.
Prof Tom Sanders, previously professor of nutrition and dietetics at King's College London, argues that age, obesity and physical inactivity are the main risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes.
Hidden sugar
How much sugar is hiding in your food?
And he points out that most new cases are seen in people over the age of 50 - an age group not traditionally associated with sugary drink consumption.
He added: ""It is important to stress that this study does not prove a cause-effect relationship and there are no trials as yet showing that reducing sugar-sweetened beverages decreases the incidence of type 2 diabetes.""
However, he acknowledges there is evidence that the disease can be prevented by increasing physical activity and losing weight - which can include restricting sugary drinks.
Dr Alasdair Rankin, director of research at the charity Diabetes UK, said the study added to evidence that sugary drinks are bad for health and can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes but suggested further work is needed to understand this.
He added: ""It does not provide strong evidence about whether this is because of the calories they contain or if there is something else going on in the body that is leading to an increase in risk.""","A study by researchers at the University of Cambridge has found that sugary drinks could be linked to an increased risk of diabetes, regardless of weight.

612,"Best known for its part in bringing the internet into being, the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency has more recently brought engineers together to tackle what it considers to be ""grand challenges"".
These competitions try to accelerate research into issues it believes deserve greater attention - they gave rise to serious work on autonomous vehicles and saw the first stumbling steps towards robots that could help in disaster zones.
Next is a Cyber Grand Challenge that aims to develop software smart enough to spot and seal vulnerabilities in other programs before malicious hackers even know they exist.
""Currently, the process of creating a fix for a vulnerability is all people, and it's a process that's reactive and slow,"" said Mike Walker, head of the Cyber Grand Challenge at Darpa.
This counted as a grand challenge, he said, because of the sheer complexity of modern software and the fundamental difficulty one computer had in understanding what another was doing - a problem first explored by computer pioneer Alan Turing.
He said the need for quick fixes would become more pressing as the world became populated by billions of small, smart net-connected devices - the so-called internet of things.
""The idea is that these devices will be used in such quantities that without automation we just will not be able to field any effective network defence,"" he said.
The cyber challenge climaxes this week at the Def Con hacker convention, where seven teams will compete to see whose software is the best hacker.
But automated, smart digital defences are not limited to Darpa's cyber arena.
Software clever enough to spot a virus without human aid is already being widely used.
A lot of what anti-virus software did had to be automatic, said Darren Thomson, chief technology officer at Symantec, because of the sheer number of malicious programs the bad guys had created.
There are now thought to be more than 500 million worms, Trojans and other viruses in circulation. Millions more appear every day.
That automation helped, said Mr Thomson, because traditional anti-virus software was really bad at handling any malware it had not seen before.
""Only about 30-40% of all the things we protect people against are caught by these programs,"" he said.
For the rest, said Mr Thomson, security companies relied on increasingly sophisticated software that could generalise from the malware it did know to spot the malicious code it did not.
Added to this are behavioural systems that keep an eye on programs as they execute and sound the alarm if they do something unexpected.
Some defence systems put programs they are suspicious about in a virtual container and then use different techniques to try to make the code ""detonate"" and reveal its malicious intent.
""We simulate keystrokes and make it look like it is interacting with users to make the malware believe it's really being used,"" Mr Thomson said.
The rise of big data has also helped spur a step towards security software that can help improve the chances of catching the 60-70% of malicious threats that traditional anti-virus can miss.
""Machine learning helps you look at the core DNA of the malware families rather than the individual cases,"" said Tomer Weingarten, founder and chief executive of security company SentinelOne.
The approach had emerged from the data science world, said Mr Weingarten, and was proving useful because of the massive amount of data companies quickly gathered when they started to monitor PCs for malicious behaviour.
""There is a lot of data, and a lot of it is repetitive,"" he said.
""Those are the two things you need to build a very robust learning algorithm that you can teach what's bad and what's good.
""If you want to do something malicious, you have to act, and that is something that will be forever anomalous to the normal patterns.""
Automating this anomaly detection is essential because it would be impossible for a human, or even a lot of humans, to do the same in a reasonable amount of time.
And it is not just PCs that are better protected thanks to machine learning.
When it comes to large companies and governments, cyber-thieves are keen to lurk on their internal networks while seeking out the really juicy stuff such as customer databases, designs for new products or details of contract negotiations and bids.
It was another situation in which the machines outstripped their human masters, said Justin Fier, director of cyber-intelligence at security company Dark Trace.
""You can take a large dataset and have the machine learn and then use advanced mathematics to pull out the needle in the haystack that does not belong,"" he said.
""Sometimes, it will get the subtle anomaly that you might not catch with the human eye.""
However, said Mr Fier, it would be wrong to think of machine learning as true AI.
It was a step towards that kind of approach, he said, but regularly needed human intelligence to make the final decision about some of the events the smart software picked out.
And, he said, the usefulness of machine learning might not lie entirely with those who used it for defence.
""We had one incident in which we caught malware that was just watching users and logging their habits,"" he said.
""We have to assume that it was trying to determine the most suitable way to exfiltrate data without triggering alarms.
""Where the malware starts to use machine learning is when it's going to get really interesting.""","The Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is known for bringing together engineers to tackle ""grand challenges"" that accelerate research into issues it believes deserve greater attention.

The LGA says this would allow councils to intervene much more swiftly when parents raise concerns about a school.
Ministers say becoming an academy is the best way to improve standards.
But David Simmonds, chairman of the LGA's Children and Young People Board, said 80% of maintained schools were rated as good or outstanding by Ofsted inspectors.
These schools were, therefore, in a strong position to help other council controlled schools which were struggling, he told the BBC.
He said that when parents had concerns about standards in a non-academy school, they turned to the local authority for help.
""We could intervene much more swiftly, but there's a requirement that schools convert to academy status before being able to sponsor a struggling school - now that takes time.
""It's a piece of bureaucracy that doesn't need to be there.""
Mr Simmonds said the Education and Adoption Bill, which has been presented to and debated in the Commons and is now being examined by the Public Bill Committee, would be an opportunity to remove the restriction.
""For parents, who are far more concerned with the quality of their child's education in the classroom than the legal status of the school, it is the council that they still turn to for advice and support.
""However, their current powers to intervene are strictly limited.
""The Education and Adoption Bill provides the ideal opportunity to right this wrong and should allow councils and the best maintained schools to share expertise and provide support to school leadership teams to ensure standards rapidly improve.""
But the government says the bill will ""remove bureaucratic and legal loopholes"" that slow down the process of turning failing schools themselves into academies.
A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ""We are clear that the most effective way of bringing about rapid and sustained improvement is to become an academy with the support of a strong sponsor.
""All good and outstanding schools have the freedom to convert to academy status either as standalone converters or as part of a multi-academy trust to share their expertise with other schools.
""Academies are a vital part of our plan for education and the advantages and freedoms enjoyed by these schools are transforming the education of millions of pupils across the country.""

He said Mr Jones experienced ""an almost instantaneous opening of his parachute"", which could have caused him to fall unconscious. He said parachutes should normally take between four and five seconds to fully open.
Joseph Graves, who was the drop zone controller at the airfield, told the hearing he saw Mr Jones freefall for 19 seconds before his parachute opened.
He said it soon began to spiral and ""it continued to spiral but Chris did not seem to make any move"".
Mr Montgomery said such ""hard"" openings could be caused by untidy packing of a parachute and could ""take your breath away"".
Another witness Andrew Shaw told the court that Mr Jones' parachute had been repaired after a previous hard opening in April last year.
He had also been advised to look at the way he packed his parachute but it had been marked as serviceable less than a week before his death, the inquest heard.

BP argued that the deal meant it could fall prey to inflated or bogus compensation claims.
BP agreed to the compensation deal in 2012, but argues it has been misinterpreted.
Shares in BP fell 1.7% in London on Monday.
BP asked the Supreme Court to consider whether people and businesses seeking payments under the settlement included individuals who had not actually suffered any injury as a result of the oil spill.
The Supreme Court's rejection of this appeal by BP is the latest in a series of setbacks for the oil firm.
BP is trying to limit payments over the environmental disaster, which claimed the lives of 11 people and became the largest US offshore oil spill in history.
The settlement agreement has no cap, but BP initially estimated that it would pay roughly $7.8bn (Â£6.1bn) to compensate victims.
It now says it can no longer give a reliable estimate for how much the deal will cost.
BP has already paid out $2.3bn in so-called business economic loss claims out of a total of $4.25bn in compensation claims to individuals and businesses, according to Patrick Juneau, the administrator appointed by the courts to handle claims.
The settlement process is also separate from other court proceedings relating to the spill, including environmental and criminal penalties.
BP has set aside $43bn to resolve all claims.

Dawn Airey, former boss of Channel 5, and Dame Colette Bowe, former chairwoman of Ofcom, are among the advisers.
The current BBC charter is set to expire at the end of 2016.
Ms Airey, who is an executive at Yahoo, has previously called for the licence fee to be cut and to consider charging for website output.
Meanwhile, The Sunday Times has reported that a government green paper is due to be published on Thursday which will ask fundamental questions about the BBC's role, including whether it should stop chasing viewers and provide more public service programmes.
The green paper will look at exploring options to replace the Â£145.50 licence fee, with a household tax or subscription system, the paper said.
It will also suggest that the BBC website should be scaled back, question whether the corporation's news fulfils its obligation to be impartial, examine whether more of the broadcaster's output should be independently produced and consider the future of BBC Worldwide - the corporation's commercial arm - the paper reported.
The Sunday Times also said the green paper would look at replacing the BBC Trust with Ofcom.
Mr Whittingdale said: ""Each member of the independent advisory group brings individual skills, experience and expertise.
""Together they will contribute to the oversight of the government's review of the BBC royal charter. I look forward to working with them on this important issue.""
Other members of the panel include: Shazam executive chairman Andrew Fisher, Arts Council England boss Darren Henley, Johnston Press chief executive Ashley Highfield, former Shine Group chief executive Alex Mahon, digital entrepreneur Lopa Patel and journalism professor Stewart Purvis, a former editor-in-chief of ITN.
Mr Whittingdale's predecessor Sajid Javid, now business secretary, said the charter review should address what the BBC broadcasts and its ""internet capabilities"".

""I think this is a matter for real concern,"" he added.
He said there was always room for debate over what the BBC does but the government's approach ""feels like the beating up of the BBC to make it more compliant, less bold and that's really not in our national interest"".

643,"The allegation was made by Edgar Matobato, a self-confessed former death squad member, before a Senate inquiry on extra-judicial killings.
Mr Duterte, he alleged, ordered him and others to kill about 1,000 criminals or political rivals over a 25-year period.
One government minister called the allegations ""lies and fabrications""
Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre said Mr Matobato was ""obviously not telling the truth"" while presidential spokesman Martin Andanar said investigations into the president's time as mayor had gone nowhere.
Mr Matobato, 57, said he had been a member of the Davao Death Squad, a notorious vigilante group allegedly responsible for hundreds of killings.
""Our job was to kill criminals like drug pushers, rapists, snatchers,"" he said.
But he also said that Mr Duterte's opponents had been targeted too, including four bodyguards of a local rival for mayor, Prospero Nograles.
In 1993, he said his group had injured a justice department agent after a confrontation at a road block.
""Mayor Duterte was the one who finished him off,"" he said.
""Jamisola [the justice department official] was still alive when he [Duterte] arrived. He emptied two Uzi magazines on him.""
Victims would be shot or strangled, he said, with some disembowelled and dumped into the sea so fish could eat them, or in one case fed to a crocodile.
He told the Senate panel he had gone from a witness protection programme into hiding when Mr Duterte became president, fearing for his life.
Mr Matobato also alleged Mr Duterte had ordered the bombing of a mosque in retaliation for an attack on Davao Cathedral in 1993.
On this claim, Mr Duterte's spokesman, Martin Andanar, said ""I don't think he is capable of giving those orders.""
He said the country's Commission on Human Rights had failed to even prove the existence of the Davao Death Squad.
Prospero Nograles' son Karlo, a Davao city representative, challenged Mr Matobato's account relating to his father's bodyguards.
""I don't know what this guy is talking about,"" he wrote on Facebook.
""I can only suspect that this guy is being manipulated by some people to only serve their own selfish interests.""
The woman leading the Senate inquiry into extra-judicial killings, Leila de Lima, is a strong critic of Mr Duterte and has been accused by him of having links to the illegal drug trade, something she denies.
At one point, she and an ally of Mr Duterte, Senator Alan Peter Cayetano, clashed, with Mr Cayetano questioning Mr Matobato's credibility and accusing him of being part of a plot to unseat the Philippines' president.
Mr Duterte became mayor of Davao in 1988, and his tough stance saw crime rates plummet, an approach he has vowed to replicate at national level.
In June, after winning the presidency he effectively sanctioned the public killing of drug suspects, telling a rally ""if you destroy my country, I will kill you"".
Since his election more than 3,000 drug users and dealers have been killed in police operations or by vigilantes, according to the authorities, amid international alarm over human rights violations.
But Mr Duterte has dismissed concerns over his drugs policies, calling UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon ""a fool"" and referring to US President Barack Obama as a ""son of a whore"", something he later said he regretted.","Edgar Matobato, a self-confessed former death squad member, has made allegations before a Senate inquiry that President Rodrigo Duterte ordered him and others to kill about 1,000 criminals or political rivals over a 25-year period.

An invasion by Villa supporters held up the tie in injury time and home fans also ran on at the end, while seats were thrown from the West Brom end.
Pulis expects the FA to investigate what happened during and after Villa's 2-0 West Midlands derby win.
""It's disgraceful. We don't want to see those scenes,"" said Pulis.
In a statement, the Villa board apologised to ""the Football Association, the West Bromwich Albion directors, manager Tony Pulis and all his staff and players"".
It added: ""The club does not condone supporters invading the field of play under any circumstances.
""We are very disappointed that what should have been a very memorable and proud moment for our fans was marred by the actions of those who could not control themselves.
""They have let both themselves and their club down.""
Referee Anthony Taylor was forced to halt the game in stoppage time, with Villa leading 2-0, as home fans spilled onto the pitch.
Many fans remaining in the stands booed the pitch invaders and chanted for them to leave the field.
The match resumed after a short delay, before another invasion after the final whistle.
Pulis said the pitch invasions should lead to Aston Villa reviewing their security measures.
""If you're Villa, you need to look at the stewards as they came over to our fans and there was nobody there,"" he said.

""It puts players in danger and you don't want to see that. You would see that in the 1970s and 80s and you don't want to see that again.
""I'm sure the FA will look at it without me poking my nose in. If we had a lot of stewards it would be sorted out.""
Villa manager Tim Sherwood, whose team beat West Brom 2-1 in the Premier League on Tuesday, said he ""could not condone the fans entering the field of play"" but added: ""I have to say, to be totally honest I can understand their emotions.
""They have just beaten their local rivals twice in a week, once in an FA Cup quarter-final, and emotions are running very high, but the club can't condone those actions, especially if anyone was touched.""

Aston Villa goalscorer Fabian Delph was surrounded by fans at the final whistle.
""My armband got nicked, someone got my left boot, but I could appreciate the relief the fans are feeling after a result like that,"" he told BBC Sport.
""It was dangerous. Someone tried to take my boot off. People tried to kiss me and were biting me. It was scary.""
Mark Lawrenson, who was co-commentator for the match which was broadcast live on BBC One, said: ""Why would you do this? You're winning, absolutely stupid. Loads of villages have lost their idiots tonight. Absolutely bonkers.
""It's like a scene from the 1980s all over again. Absolutely ridiculous.""
Match of the Day studio pundit Kevin Phillips said: ""I think there's going to be repercussions for Villa here as I don't think there was enough police or stewards to stop them coming on the pitch.
""Seeing seats fly down from the stands… it could kill someone. They'll identify these people and they should be banned for the rest of their lives.""
""The ill-feeling between these two fierce West Midlands rivals provided a tense undercurrent throughout and boiled over in a threatening atmosphere over the final few minutes.
""West Brom fans, angered by Claudio Yacob's unjust red card and a second Villa goal from Scott Sinclair, threw several seats they had ripped out on to the pitch.
""The response from Villa fans was that premature pitch invasion, although it should be stressed it was a minority and thousands of their own supporters vented their fury against them.

651,"Ms Park, who defeated liberal rival Moon Jae-in in December's general election, took the oath of office in front of tens of thousands of people.
North Korea's recent nuclear test posed a ""challenge to the survival"" of the Korean people, she said.
Trust-building was needed to tackle the ""extremely serious"" security situation.
Ms Park, the first woman to lead South Korea, succeeds President Lee Myung-bak, of the same Saenuri Party, who stepped down as the law required after a five-year term.
The 61-year-old is the daughter of former military strongman Park Chung-hee, who ruled South Korea for almost two decades.
She takes office amid high tensions on the Korean peninsula in the wake of a North Korean nuclear test, on 12 February.
In her inauguration speech, Ms Park said she would ""not tolerate any action that threatens the lives of our people and the security of our nation"".
Profile: President-elect Park Geun-hye
""North Korea's recent nuclear test is a challenge to the survival and future of the Korean people, and there should be no mistake that the biggest victim will be none other than North Korea itself.""
Calling on North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions, she said that in a challenging security environment South Korea could not ""afford to remain where we are"".
A trust-building process was needed, she said, promising to move forward ""step-by-step on the basis of credible deterrence"".
""Trust can be built through dialogue and by honouring promises that have already been made,"" she said. ""It is my hope that North Korea will abide by international norms and make the right choice so that the trust-building process on the Korean Peninsula can move forward.""
North Korea's nuclear test - its third - followed its apparently successful launch of a three-stage rocket to put a satellite into orbit in December. That launch was condemned by the US Security Council as a banned test of missile technology; diplomatic efforts to agree a response to the nuclear test are ongoing.
Ties between the two Koreas chilled considerably under Lee Myung-bak over his move to link aid to concessions on the nuclear issue. Ahead of the election Ms Park had spoken out on the need for more dialogue but the recent nuclear test may make it harder for her to appear conciliatory towards Pyongyang, observers say.
On the economy, Ms Park promised more focus on a ""creative economy"" founded in ""economic democratisation"" that would expand beyond existing markets and sectors.
South Korea's economic growth has slowed, the population is rapidly ageing, and demands for a fairer division of wealth are now being voiced on both sides of the political divide, reports the BBC's Lucy Williamson in Seoul.
Policies would be brought in to help small and medium-sized enterprises flourish, Ms Park said.
""By rooting out various unfair practices and rectifying the misguided habits of the past... we will provide active support to ensure that everyone can live up to their fullest potential,"" she added, in an apparent nod to resentment towards the country's giant ""chaebol"" conglomerates.
She also promised a ""clean, transparent and competent government"".

653,"The Ibrox side were utterly dominant for long periods but a mixture of wastefulness and inspired goalkeeping from Scott Gallacher kept them at bay.
Jason Marr's headed goal from an Alloa corner looked like it might give the home side a shock win.
But Rangers eventually levelled after relentless pressure, Michael O'Halloran netting his first goal for the club.
The result will give Alloa renewed hope as they struggle to keep their second-tier status intact. Jack Ross's side are now nine points from safety.
All the talk before the game was about the pitch, which had recently been narrowed by nine yards. It gave the game a congested feel, but it was a lively start.
After an early Harry Forrester effort went wide for Rangers, Alloa went up the other end and Ryan Finnie's drilled effort flew past the post.
Forrester would go closer soon after, but his effort hit the post. Team-mate Jason Holt also struck the frame of the goal after neat interplay with Barrie McKay.
Rangers were in complete control of the match with their quick passing game causing Alloa plenty of problems, but too often they were guilty of over-playing in the final third.
A lack of precision was also in evidence as a back-heeled effort from Martyn Waghorn went wide of the post from just a few yards out.
The same pattern continued early in the second half, with Rangers creating chances and failing to take them. Holt had an effort well smothered by Gallacher. Andy Halliday then fired in a shot from the edge of the box, but again it was wide of goal.
Alloa would make Rangers pay for their profligacy. First a Dougie Hill header was tipped over by Wes Foderingham and, from the resultant corner, Marr's header found the net.
Substitute Billy King stung the palms of Gallacher with a near-post effort, but there was a certain flatness from the visitors as Rangers struggled to find a response. Danny Wilson managed to fire a shot through the congested ranks of Alloa defenders, but again Gallacher made the save.
Eventually Rangers found an equaliser, and it came from recent signing O'Halloran. An earlier effort from the former St Johnstone player had been well saved by Gallacher, but there was nothing the Alloa keeper could do about the strike which the forward fired into the net, much to the relief of the massed ranks of Rangers fans behind the goal.
A winner almost came, James Tavernier's header brilliantly tipped over by Gallacher.

657,"Leighton Andrews has also told local authorities to slash bureaucracy and administration costs as public spending cuts continue to bite.
He has set up an independent review to find where savings can be made.
Councils have warned key services could be ""dismantled"" due to £146m in budget cuts next year.
The review comes as Wales' 22 councils face a deadline over voluntary merger talks this week.
On Monday evening, Bridgend council voted in favour of merging with the Vale of Glamorgan Council as part of the shake-up.
The findings of the administration costs view will be considered during the Welsh government's local government reform plans after the Williams Commission recommended the number of councils be cut to as few as 10.
Mr Andrews has said ""significant change"" is coming and has indicated that he is open to the idea of cutting the number of local authorities to as few as six.
He said he expected councils to focus ""limited resources"" on frontline services for the public and trim backroom spending.
""This review will enable me and local authorities to compare and contrast expenditure and understand where practice should be changed to move a greater proportion of the spending to delivering services to citizens,"" he said.
Councils have until Friday to submit their ideas for voluntary merger.
But Andrew Morgan, leader of Rhondda Cynon Taf council, warned against ""rushing"" into reorganisation.
He said his authority was not yet convinced of the case for a recommended merger with Merthyr Tydfil and was seeking talks with five neighbouring councils.
""Just putting blocks on a map together doesn't work - we need to look at the services, the cost base, and the management,"" he told BBC Radio Wales on Monday.
""If we are to work through this, it needs to be sustainable. We don't want to be rushing just to try and cut some chief executives and find out in a few years that services are starting to fail.""
Aaron Shotton, leader of Flintshire council, told BBC Radio Wales that organising a merger could cost his authority £10m although neighbouring Wrexham had already rejected the idea.
He said councils were already working hard to cut costs and further savings would be difficult to find.
""Already we've taken out £2.5m of senior management costs this year - you can't repeat that - and we've already set a challenging [savings] target of over £1m of administration costs so it's something we're already doing,"" he said.
""If we protect social care and education, that leave us with £80m [a year] for everything else that we spend across the council from which we'll have to find £50m [in savings] over the next three years.

660,"It is a strategy big on ideas and big on numbers, although as is often the case in these type of documents, there is not much in the way of detail.
But the themes in there are loud and clear.
And the picture on page 49 broadly sums up the transport nirvana the mayor is trying to achieve.
As the mayor's document says: ""Londoners need quiet, safe, accessible streets that are not dominated by motorised traffic and that are pleasant for walking, cycling and spending time.""
Mr Khan is trying to tackle a growing population and increasing congestion.
It is predicted London's population will grow from 8.7 million today to an estimated 10.5 million in 25 years time.
So the mayor wants to shift emphasis from vehicles to walking, cycling and public transport. He calls it ""changing the mix"".
This is not a new idea - former mayor Boris Johnson's policies tried to do something similar in his second term.
But Mr Khan's targets seem more ambitious and challenging. He wants to cut car journeys by three million a day.
By 2041, he wants 80% of all Londoners' trips to be made on foot, by bike or on public transport and to do that, he wants to make them more attractive.
There will also be investment in improving public services, and expect more lobbying for Crossrail 2.
There are carrots for drivers to leave their cars at home, but there are also sticks.
It will mean more bike lanes and more areas where vehicles are banned.
The strategy says potential vehicle-free zones are ""not about being anti-car, but about supporting Londoners in moving around the city without having to rely solely on cars"".
It will also become more difficult and expensive to drive certain vehicles in large parts of London.
Polluting vehicles will be charged more with the ultra low emission zone (uLEZ) whose standards will be tightened.
New building developments may not have parking and there could be charges for work parking spaces.
The strategy also calls for all taxis and private hire vehicles to be zero emission capable by 2033, for all buses to be zero emission by 2037, for all new road vehicles driven in London to be zero emission by 2040, and for London's entire transport system to be zero emission by 2050.
The mayor also wants to reduce freight traffic by 10% by 2026.
And he wants to be able to put a cap on minicab (PHV) drivers. There are currently 18,000 different PHV vehicles entering the congestion charging zone each day during charging hours.
Importantly, it also looks like a reform of the congestion charge is on the cards which could mean extending the hours of use or including more vehicles.
And road charging will be considered. That could mean paying different amounts depending on the time of day, distance and how polluting the engine in your car is.
That is very unusual as politicians don't usually like talking about road charging.
The details of all of the themes will emerge in the coming years but not surprisingly, even these themes have split opinion.
Tompion Platt, head of policy and communications at Living Streets, said it was ""fantastic to see the mayor set a target to reduce our reliance on cars"".
""Reducing car use and enabling more Londoners to walk their everyday journeys will improve the health and happiness of everyone living and working in the capital,"" he added.
But Steve McNamara from the London Taxi Drivers' Association (LTDA) accused the mayor of swerving the main issues.
""This policy will do nothing to relieve congestion or pollution,"" he said.
""Minicabs should pay the congestion charge and the times should be extended to midnight.""
Supporters say this is a bold and radical strategy. Critics say it does nothing to solve London's congestion now.
The public consultation will be open until 2 October 2017.","The document outlines London Mayor Sadiq Khan's strategy to tackle increasing population and congestion in the city.

661,"In just three months the figure has increased by 6,895.
More than two thirds of patients were waiting more than nine weeks, in spite of targets stating that at least 50% of patients should wait no longer that.
The Department of Health statistics also reveal that more than 53,000 men and women have been waiting at least a year to see a consultant.
The target is that no-one should have to wait for longer than one year.
The new statistics show that all relevant targets have been breached.
Derek McCambley, whose health is deteriorating due to his multiple sclerosis, had been waiting two years to see a consultant in 2016.
According to guidelines from the National Institute For Health and Clinical Excellence, he should see his consultant twice a year.
He finally got to see the specialist earlier this year.
""After waiting two years I finally got an appointment but I got to see him for about 10 minutes,"" said Mr McCambley.
""Before getting in I had to wait an hour-and-a-half in the waiting room - I was frazzled by the time I got to see him face-to-face.
""It's not the doctors' fault, it's the system.""
Eighty-four-year-old Laura Price has been waiting for two years for a knee operation, and said she was in ""a lot of pain"".
""It's not fair really to wait so long - but then again there's nothing I can do about it,"" she said.
""If the hospitals don't have the doctors or nurses, what can I do? I just have to put up with it.""
The figures highlight a system that is heaving under pressure.
With no mechanism in place to tackle the hospital waiting lists, their increase comes as no surprise.
A number of facts remain unchanged, including that there continues to be an uncertain budget.
The numbers requiring care continue to rise against a backdrop of no change in the number of medical staff and hospital beds available.
With the absence of a Northern Ireland Executive and a health minister, there continues to be a lack of leadership.
That position also means that health policies, including one that specifically targets hospital waiting lists, remains unimplemented on the health minister's desk.
The BBC has seen hospital waiting times for the Southern Health and Social Care Trust.
Currently, those waiting for a urology appointment have been told to expect a wait of at least 157 weeks.
Some orthopaedic appointments are showing a 95-week wait, with pain management sitting at 118 weeks.
A consultant who works in the Southern Health and Social Care Trust told the BBC that the system simply cannot cope and patients were suffering.
The lack of leadership and money was having a detrimental impact on the overall running of the health service, the consultant added.
The doctor said that the sooner politics at Stormont started working again, the better.
Another point was that, even if the political wheel starts turning, politicians have to agree that something radical needs to happen about how the service is being managed.
By March this year 121,786 people had attended hospital to see a consultant for the first time.
That marks an increase of 3.8%, or 4,453, in the previous quarter.
However, overall fewer people saw a consultant this March compared with the same time last year, which recorded 148,476 people seeing their consultant for the first time.
The current ministerial target for inpatient and day case waiting times states that 55% of patients should wait no longer than 13 weeks, with no patient waiting longer than 52 weeks.
In March, a total of 71,483 men and women were waiting for admission to hospital - about 700 more than three months previously.
Also 40,037 people had been waiting more than 13 weeks, with 9,615 waiting more than a year.

662,"State TV said the local head of military intelligence was among the dead and some reports say more than 40 died. Jihadist group Tahrir al-Sham said it carried out the attacks.
Homs has been under government control since December 2015 when rebels left under a ceasefire deal.
Syria's government said the attacks would not go unanswered.
Its UN Ambassador Bashar al-Jaafari, who leads the government delegation at peace talks in Geneva, said they were a message to the talks from ""the sponsors of terrorism"".
He demanded that all opposition groups present denounce the violence, saying direct talks could only be held with a unified opposition.
Syria's main opposition camp later said that it condemned ""all terrorist operations committed by terrorist groups"".
UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura said he hoped the attacks would not affect the talks.
""It was tragic, terrible, and that's why, you know, I'm expecting during these talks unfortunately spoilers,"" he said.
""Every time we had talk, or negotiation, there was always someone who tried to spoil it. We were expecting that.""
Tahrir al Sham which is led by al-Qaeda's former affiliate in Syria, is part of neither the current ceasefire nor the peace talks.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group, said attackers targeted the headquarters of military security in the city and also a branch of state security.
The attacks took place in the heavily guarded Ghouta and Mahatta districts.
State TV said provincial army intelligence chief General Hassan Daabul, a close associate of President Bashar al-Assad, was among the dead.
After the attacks, government planes carried out air strikes on the last opposition enclave in Homs, though rebels there are not connected to Tahrir al-Sham.
The jihadists said five of their fighters had taken part in the assault.
The group was formed when Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, known as the Nusra Front until it broke off formal ties with al-Qaeda last July, merged with four smaller Syrian factions.
Earlier this month it announced that its leader was Hashim al-Sheikh, who previously served as head of the powerful Islamist rebel group, Ahrar al-Sham.","The Syrian government said that attacks in Homs, which killed at least 40 people including the local head of military intelligence, were a message from ""the sponsors of terrorism"".

664,"The Student Loans Company (SLC) said ""human error"" on their part was to blame.
The mistake affects 31 students who began Master's degrees at English universities in September 2016.
They have been told that loans of up to £10,000 were ""incorrectly awarded"" to them, and they will not receive them.
The parent of one of the affected students said their son had been left ""distraught"" and ""in limbo"" due to the error.
They did not want to be identified as their son is considering appealing the decision by the SLC to withdraw the loan offer.
They said their son had signed a number of agreements after being originally told he would get the £10,000 loan.
""He finalised the arrangements for his accommodation and he travelled over to England to register with the university and settled in to his new accommodation,"" they said.
""The letter he got from Student Finance England, which approved his loan, said the expected payment date of the first instalment would be 26 September.
""However, when he checked his bank account and the money wasn't there he telephoned the Student Loans Company to find out what had happened and it was at that stage they told him he wouldn't be getting the money.
""He was on the phone telling me what had happened, asking: 'What'll I do? Am I going to have to come home? What about my rent? What about my master's course? How am I going to pay for this?'""
They said their son does not know if he will be able to raise the money to complete his master's degree.
""He is still in limbo,"" they said.
""This is causing a lot of stress to students and their families and it's messing about with people's lives.""
A student loan system for postgraduate Master's degrees - which usually take a year to complete - began in England in September 2016.
The government-backed loans are worth up to £10,000 and can be used to pay tuition fees and living costs.
Thirty-one Northern Irish students received letters from Student Finance England, on behalf of the SLC, in early September, which confirmed they would receive a loan.
The students had completed undergraduate degrees in England and believed they were eligible for the postgraduate funding there.
However, the students were subsequently notified, after the university year had started in late September, that the funding had been ""incorrectly awarded"" and that they would not receive their loan after all.
They were told that they did not ""meet the residency requirements to be eligible for a postgraduate loan,"" as they had moved to England to study.
NUS-USI President Fergal McFerran said the withdrawal of loan offers was a ""very troubling development that could have massive negative ramifications for the 31 students affected"".
""These students will likely have planned and budgeted their year ahead on the basis of having this loan after being given an offer of this loan,"" he said.
""Why should the financial situation of these students potentially be put in jeopardy because of a change of mind from the Student Loans Company? I do not see how the Student Loans Company can see this as an acceptable situation.""
In a statement to the BBC, SLC said that the mistake arose ""as a result of human error in the interpretation of the regulations when processing"" the loan applications.

666,"The Department for Education (DfE) said specialist staff were vital to ensure children developed ""a sporting habit for life"".
Funding worth Â£360,000 would be put towards training primary teachers with a specialism in PE, the DfE said.
It is hoped 240 primary PE specialists will take up posts by September 2015.
A pilot training programme was launched last year, with the first cohort of 120 PE specialists due to be working in primary schools from this autumn.
Children's minister Edward Timpson said: ""PE teaching is a specialist role and deserves bespoke support. PE specialists are vital to really embedding sporting expertise in schools, as well as giving children every chance of developing a sporting habit for life.
""That's why we've announced extra funding to create a second intake of specialist primary PE teachers to support other teachers in developing their skills and improve quality of PE teaching.
""The pilot has already attracted high-calibre graduates who want to share their love of sport. We must harness this and ensure more schools across the country can benefit from their expertise.""
Trainee teachers on the programme study PE and sport for 50% of their overall course, as well as training in the other core subjects.
About three-quarters of the trainees currently taking part in the pilot scheme had a sports-related degree, the DfE said, and many graduated with a 2:1 or higher.
The vast majority of the trainees had already accepted job offers for this autumn, the department added.
Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers said: ""We welcome this new funding for primary sports specialists.
""Properly deployed they can raise the skill and confidence of all staff in teaching PE. They can broaden the range of sport and exercise on offer and help nurture a new generation of athletes.
""It is vital that we maintain a broad and balanced curriculum as start children on healthy habits early. Teachers in primary schools have to be 'masters of all trades' but specialist support can back them up.""
The DfE announcement follows a warning from the schools watchdog, Ofsted, that too many pupils are being denied the chance to take part in competitive sport  in state schools, where it can be treated as an ""optional extra"".
In a report, Ofsted said children's education was poorer if they were deprived of the chance to compete.
The report also highlighted concerns that top athletes in some sports were still more likely to come from fee-paying schools rather than the state sector.
The report - Going the extra mile: Excellence in competitive school sport - was commissioned after the 2012 Olympic games in London to explore why so many Team GB athletes had been educated in private rather than state schools.","The Department for Education (DfE) has announced extra funding worth £360,000 to create a second intake of specialist primary PE teachers.

""We show load is safe, and it looks like we've caught a Dragon,"" said Major Tim.
The capsule, sent up by private contractor SpaceX, is carrying just over three tonnes of equipment.
Included in the shipment is an expandable room that will be fitted to the ISS in the coming weeks.
Also in the cargo are Chinese cabbage seeds that astronauts will attempt to grow in orbit, and a group of mice which will be used to test drugs that might help combat muscle and bone loss in the weightless environment of space.
Meanwhile back on Earth, the main stage of the Falcon rocket that sent the Dragon on its way to the station on Friday has returned to port in Florida.
The booster made a return to a drone ship stationed out in the Atlantic after completing its ascent - the first time in five attempts that SpaceX had managed to recover one of its vehicles at sea.
SpaceX CEO Elon Musk told reporters that the stage would now be re-fired on the ground to check its condition.
If no problems are found, it could make another flight, perhaps in June, Mr Musk said.
""This is a really good milestone for the future of spaceflight; I think it's another step towards the stars.
""In order for us to really open up access to space, we've got to achieve full and rapid re-usability, and being able to do that for the primary rocket booster is going to be a huge impact on cost.
""It's still going to take us a few years to make that smooth, make it efficient, but it's proven that it can work.
""There'll probably be some failures in the future, but we'll iron those out and get it to the point where it's routine and where the only changes to the rocket are to hose it down, add the propellant and fly again.""

""We can look forward to faster rates of economic growth as we embrace the world economy,"" John Hearn, economist at the London Institute of Banking and Finance said.

You have shared bugbears like: ""Why are there always roadworks on the M6 into Birmingham?""
And asked ""Why is Shropshire also known as Salop?"" Here is how we have got on with answering your questions.
Every day 320 million litres of water travels 73 miles (117 km) from Wales to Birmingham to fill kettles, baths and boilers. But why does it come so far?
It dates back to the Victorian era when Birmingham was a rapidly growing city plagued by illnesses like cholera and typhoid, which were caused by contaminated water.
A search for clean water sparked an ""amazing feat of ingenuity"" to bring it from the Welsh hills to the city.
For drivers commuting in and out of Birmingham during rush hour it can feel like there are ""always"" roadworks. Car-clogged roads are made even worse for drivers with regular diversions and temporary traffic lights. But why are there so many road works on the M6 and A38?
""Quite simply, it means army ford from the Old English,"" said Rhys Griffith, senior archivist at Herefordshire Archive and Records Centre.
""The Anglo-Saxon for army is Here. It is likely that Hereford had emerged as an Anglo-Saxon ecclesiastical centre and a military frontier settlement by the end of the 8th Century.""
""Salop is an old abbreviation for Shropshire, which comes from the Anglo-French Salopesberia,"" said local historian Keith Pybus.
Salop was was also a Latin name for the county town, Shrewsbury, which also shares the motto of Floreat Salopia, which means let Shrewsbury, or Shropshire, flourish.""

672,"Swindon were relegated to League Two and are without a manager following the departure of head coach Luke Williams.
An approach for Mansfield boss Steve Evans was denied and after missing an appointment deadline Power admits the process is taking longer than expected.
""We hoped to have something a bit closer than we are by this time,"" the 44-year-old told BBC Wiltshire.
Williams won just 20 of his 75 games in charge of the Robins and left the club along with first-team coach Ross Embleton and sports scientist Mike Cooper after their 22nd-place finish in League One.
Partick Thistle boss Alan Archibald and former Queens Park Rangers boss Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink have been linked with the job, but Power is still searching.
He said: ""[The shortlist] is down to three [people]. But the club is changing direction this season, all the responsibility regarding players coming in and out and everything really will be down to the manager - so it's important we get the right one in.
""We're trying to look for people with experience that can get us out of this league and knows players at this level.""
Swindon ended their five-season stay in League One six points from safety and Power believes poor recruitment was to blame for their relegation.
""Last season it was very evident that we didn't do the recruitment properly,"" he said. ""I feel that next season we need to go down a more traditional route and that's what we're going to try and do.""
However, the former Norwich and Bradford forward is confident the club can use their resources better next season.
""Obviously next season we'll have one of the highest budgets, if not the highest budgets [in the league],"" he added.
""There are a lot of advantages - the manager will take 100% control of the football side. There's a blank canvas there for the right person to get on with the job.""
Swindon will take a ""completely different direction next year"", according to Power, who aims to get the club back into League One ""by hook or by crook.""
Part of that change will come in the club's structure, with Tim Sherwood's role as director of football set to be scrapped.
""I think that in all likeliness, when the new manager comes in, that Tim will move on,"" Power said.
""Tim just needed to come in, evaluate what we had at the football club and what we needed for the [January] transfer window.

It is the first programme to be fronted by Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May since they parted company with the BBC last year.
Writing in the Evening Standard, Ben Travis described it as a ""stunningly beautiful show"".
""If The Grand Tour is basically Top Gear with a nitros boost of Amazon finances, the difference is immediately apparent,"" he said.
""Those who have never counted themselves as Jeremy Clarkson fans aren't exactly going to be won over here.

Jeremy Clarkson tweeted: ""Genuinely relieved and grateful today. Huge thanks to everyone who has sent messages.""
Analysis by Will Gompertz, BBC arts editor
Filmic is the word that sprang to my mind when watching The Grand Tour.
The scale of the production, the quality of the cameras, the epic sweeping shots and the pastiches of old movies - it seemed the show was aimed at the big screen, not the telly. Or a mobile phone, which is how I imagine a lot of people will view it.
It opens with a scene so over-the-top and opulent you'd think that the Prince Regent was behind the camera. Think Mad Max meets Easy Rider as we see the three presenters drive across the Californian desert, making their way through a sea of cars all barrelling along to a massive stage that has risen from the sand like a pyramid.
Maybe the small screen is too small for Clarkson, Hammond and May, and their next step should be away from the internet and into the cinema.

Writing in The Guardian, Sam Wollaston said: ""More than format, more even than the amount of money you throw at something, what really gives a television show its personality is the personnel.
""You can pour something into a different container, but it still tastes the same. And, like it or not, this tastes of Clarkson, Hammond and May.""
He added: ""Fans of old Top Gear are going to be happy.""
However Andrew Billen in The Times struck a dissenting note, saying the show took ""few risks"" and said ""the idea tank is running dangerously low"".
He wrote: ""For a show about speed, this played very slowly to me and is the main reason that the programme came in at a bloated 1 hour 10 minutes.
""Before we see the next 11 episodes, I hope [producer Andy] Wilman returns to the editing suite and brings them down to 50 minutes.""
The first episode of the series saw the trio take their travelling studio tent to Dry Rabbit Lake in the Mojave Desert in California.
Vehicles featured in the episode included hybrid hyper-cars such as the McLaren P1, the Porsche 918 Spyder and the Ferrari LaFerrari.
The Telegraph's Ed Power said: ""The Grand Tour isn't a shameless Top Gear rip-off. But under the hood the rival franchises have a great deal in common.""
He added: ""The new series will certainly go some way towards obliterating memories of Top Gear's terrible Chris Evans-fronted relaunch. Petrolheads can rejoice.
""The BBC may wonder how Matt LeBlanc and whoever joins him next year can possibly compete.""
Dan Wootton gave The Grand Tour five stars in his review for The Sun.
""Being sacked from the BBC was the greatest thing that ever happened to Clarkson and co - and the world of cars on TV,"" he wrote.
""This has guns, explosions, super yachts, madcap stunts, the British Institute of Car Chases, dramatic crashes, a sinking ship and HammÂ­ond being dangled from a chopper.
""But the one thing that really matters is Clarkson being reunited with his two mates on screen.""
Digital Spy's Tom Eames said: ""Clarkson, Hammond and May's reunion â€‹is silly but worth the wait (and money).
""It's precisely all the things we loved about their old show, but bigger, brighter and more blow-upier.
""And they've sort of somehow come up with the world's first scripted comedy factual show, and it works perfectly.""
Writing in The Daily Mail, James Shelley said: ""The Grand Tour had a new sense of excitement and knowledge about the cars but the same old warm friendship.
""It's a shame they had to leave the BBC but judging by episode one of The Grand Tour perhaps that was what they needed.""
Earlier this week, the show's producer Andy Wilman told the BBC they would use social media to determine if the show was a success, as they would not find out the viewing figures.
""We'll never know the number, because, even to us, Amazon won't tell us what the viewing figures are.""
Asked how they will know if viewers like the show, Wilman replied: ""We'll get it from Twitter I would imagine.""
Some viewers stayed up late to watch the programme when it went live just before midnight on Thursday evening, and many tweeted their thoughts.
The first series of The Grand Tour will consist of 12 hour-long episodes - with one being made available each week.
A total of 36 episodes across three years have been commissioned by Amazon.
Currently, only fans in the UK, America, Germany and Japan are able to watch the first episode.
But the company has announced it will be launching the show globally in December.
The new series does not include features such as ""star in a reasonably-priced car"" or ""tame racing driver"" The Stig, as those belong to the BBC's Top Gear format.
LeBlanc and Evans took over presenting duties on Top Gear after Clarkson, Hammond and May's departure, though Evans left the show after one series.
Clarkson has previously said of the new show: ""I think programme one will be all right. I'd be extremely surprised if that was poorly reviewed.""

682,"The software uses a 3D representation of every artery that is 1mm across or wider, scanned from a single person.
Its accuracy passed a first key test when physicists compared blood flow in the virtual aorta with the that of real fluid in a 3D-printed replica.
Flow patterns seen in the physical copy were a good match for the simulation.
This was the case even when the fluid passing through the plastic aorta - and the virtual blood passing through the simulated aorta - was moving in pulses, to mimic the way blood is pumped by the heart.
""We're getting extremely close results both in the steady flow and the pulsatile, which is very exciting,"" lead researcher Amanda Randles, from Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, told BBC News.
She presented the findings - including the comparison with a 3D-printed aorta - this week at the American Physical Society's March Meeting in Baltimore. The whole-body simulation itself was first unveiled at a computer science conference in November.
It is called ""Harvey"" - a tribute to the 17th-century physician William Harvey who first discovered that blood is pumped in a loop around the body. At the core of Harvey's computer code is a 3D framework, built up from full-body CT and MRI scans of a single patient.
""It's not a common practice,"" said Dr Randles of the full-body scan. ""But if we have it, then we can extract the arterial network.
""We get a surface mesh representing the vessel geometry, then we decide what's a fluid node and what's a wall node, and then model fluid flow through there.""
That modelling takes place on a supercomputer at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California.
""It has 1.6 million processors, so it's one of the top 10 supercomputers,"" said Dr Randles, who worked in supercomputing at IBM before doing a physics PhD at Harvard, where she started work on Harvey.
""The first stage was simply a proof of concept: can we actually model at this scale?"" Most other simulations, she explained, have focussed on smaller sections of the circulatory system.
""The largest, I think, before this, was maybe the aortal-femoral region - so, the aorta down to about the knees.""
Modelling the flow inside every artery bigger than 1mm, at a resolution of 9 microns (0.009mm), a big step up.
One of the project's aims is to test how different interventions in cardiovascular disease - such as stents or other surgical modifications - might affect the system more widely.
""We'll be able to change the mesh file, representing the vasculature, to represent different treatment options,"" Dr Randles said.
""Typically you would look at the local haemodynamic changes, but by having a simulation of the whole body we can see how that would affect the large-scale haemodynamics.""
To validate Harvey's virtual blood flow against some real-world measurements, she added, the aorta - the biggest artery of them all - was an obvious choice.
""You can end up having turbulent flow, which you're not going to see in other parts of the body.
""We figured if we can do it there, then we've a good chance - we'd believe the rest of the model.""
So her team collaborated with that of David Frakes, an engineer at Arizona State University, on a physical comparison. They used 3D printing to create a plastic version of the scanned aorta, so that fluid could be pumped through it and its flow tracked using shiny particles.
Seeing a faithful reproduction of what the simulation had come up with, Dr Randles said, was ""pretty rewarding"".
""It's pretty straightforward to calculate analytical solutions for flow in a pipe, or flow in a curved tube. But to make sure we're really getting an accurate simulation in a complex geometry was much more difficult.""
Next, she and her colleagues are turning their attention to the other half of the system; they are already building a mesh model of the same patient's veins.
Ultimately, they hope to link the whole thing together with capillaries - the tiny vessels where red blood cells release their oxygen in single file - and even to move from fluid modelling to predicting the movement of all the individual blood cells.
If that can be done, then simulating the progress of single cancer cells through the bloodstream will also be a possibility.
But that will require a future generation of supercomputers, Dr Randles said, with at least a thousand-fold more power.
Her other hope is that their current high-level modelling will reveal the most important parameters to be measured and studied - so that patient-specific assessments can be done without the need for a supercomputer at all.
""We're trying to figure out what parts of the model we need to include, when,"" she explained.
""The goal then would be to pare down the model and run it on something much more tractable.""

Mr Putin said Russia would assist a dialogue, but stopping the fighting was a matter for Ukraine itself.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of arming the rebels, a claim repeatedly denied by the Kremlin.
""A roadmap will be prepared in order to achieve, as soon as possible, a ceasefire regime which absolutely must be bilateral in character,"" Mr Poroshenko said after two hours of talks with Mr Putin in the Belarusian capital, Minsk.
Earlier this year, Mr Poroshenko declared a unilateral ceasefire but accused the rebels of not following suit.
Prior to their one-to-one meeting, the two leaders also took part in discussions with the EU's top diplomat Catherine Ashton.
The summit came after 10 Russian soldiers were seized in Ukraine's east.
More than 2,000 people have died in fighting between Ukrainian forces and separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk.
The two regions declared independence from Kiev following Russia's annexation of the southern Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in March.
In a statement on his website after the talks, Mr Poroshenko added: ""Our main goal is peace. We are demanding decisive actions which will bring peace on Ukrainian soil.""
""The logic of a peace plan was after all supported by all the heads of state without exception.""
Meanwhile, President Putin said at a news conference that ""Russia, for its part, will do everything to support this peace process if it starts"".
But he stressed that it was up to the government in Kiev and separatist leaders in the east to work out conditions for a truce.
The two leaders reportedly agreed to hold further consultations between Ukraine's and Russia's border guard agencies.
Before the face-to-face meeting there were doubts that such talks would even go ahead, the BBC's Duncan Crawford in Minsk reports. The pair last met briefly in June at the D-Day commemorations.
Mr Poroshenko has repeatedly insisted that the only way to end the bloodshed and stabilise the region is by establishing effective border controls.
The meeting came as part of a summit taking place under the auspices of the Moscow-led Eurasian Customs Union, which also includes Belarus and Kazakhstan.
Baroness Ashton described the multilateral discussions held earlier on Tuesday as ""positive"".
""There was a sense in which the onus was on everyone to see if they could do their best to try to resolve this,"" she said.
""We called for a ceasefire linked to the proper management of borders, the importance of ensuring that humanitarian support reached people in the proper manner in full line with international law, and of course the political process"".
The EU, along with the US, has imposed sanctions on Russia for failing to rein in the separatists.
Earlier, Ukraine said its military had captured 10 Russian paratroopers near the village of Dzerkalne, near the Russian border.
A Russian defence ministry source told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti the soldiers crossed the border ""by accident"".
The source also said some 500 Ukrainian servicemen had crossed the border at various times, adding: ""We did not give much publicity to that. We just returned all those willing to return to Ukrainian territory at safe places.""
But Ukrainian military spokesman Andriy Lysenko said: ""This wasn't a mistake, but a special mission they were carrying out.""
Ukraine's media that carried the interviews quoted one man, named as Sgt Andrei Generalov, as saying: ""Stop sending in our boys. Why? This is not our war. And if we weren't here, none of this would have happened.""
Russia has repeatedly denied Ukrainian and Western accusations that it is supporting the rebels.
On Monday, Ukraine said an armoured column had crossed the border into south-eastern Ukraine, sparking clashes near Novoazovsk.

While London comes top for cocaine flushed down the toilet, Amsterdam's drains contain greater amounts of cannabis.
The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction data comes from sampling in more than 50 cities.
The results, which take into account the size of each city's population, show that on average, drug users in London relieved themselves of 737mg of cocaine per 1,000 people during the week in 2014.
The amount of cocaine in London's waste water peaks on a Friday and Saturday, but then begins to fall away dramatically on Sunday and into Monday.

Average daily amount of cocaine per 1,000 people found in London sewage during 2014
716mg in Amsterdam
632mg in Antwerp
0.2mg Smallest amount found in Jvaskyla in Finland
The amount of cocaine found in both Antwerp and Amsterdam continues to rise into Sunday, potentially suggesting that the drug's peak consumption in these cities comes  or continues later into the weekend than in the UK. A detailed analysis of weekend waste water shows that Amsterdam ranks higher than London over Saturday and Sunday alone.
Scientists around the world have been increasingly monitoring waste water in cities so they can draw a more accurate picture of drug consumption over the year.
The figures for London tally with the monitoring agency's wider research which indicates that the UK has the highest rate of cocaine use among young adults in Europe, It said that around 4% of people aged between 15 and 34 had said they had taken the drug in the 12 months leading up to the 2013/14 report. While there are fluctuations from year to year, most studies indicate that most drug use is in decline.
The scientists tested for five different drugs and found that Amsterdam came top of the league table for both ecstasy and cannabis. Oslo in Norway and Dresden in Germany had by far the highest amounts of methamphetamine in sewage - while London had no trace at all.
The annual 2015 report from the EMCDDA warns that while there were hundreds of websites openly selling so-called ""legal highs"", drug agencies had a poor understanding of the trade on the dark web - the parts of the internet which are not accessible through standard searches.
""Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, are used to facilitate anonymous transactions, and stealth packaging is used to facilitate transportation of small quantities of drugs through established commercial channels,"" said the report.
""Evidence suggests that many illicit drug purchases made on the deep web are intended for resale. Another development relates to drug supply and the sharing of drugs or drug experiences via social media, including mobile apps. This area remains both poorly understood and difficult to monitor.""
""Together, the growth of online and virtual drug markets poses major challenges to law enforcement and drug control policies. The fact that manufacturers, suppliers, retailers, website-hosting and payment processing services may all be based in different countries makes online drug markets particularly difficult to control.""","The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) has released data on drug consumption in more than 50 cities across Europe.

688,"Phil Hogan, the EU's agriculture commissioner, said he wanted to help Scotland get the money to farmers as quickly as possible.
Only about 80% of Scottish farmers have so far received their Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) payments.
The Audit Scotland watchdog has said problems with a new Scottish government IT system were largely to blame.
Mr Hogan discussed the issues with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and her new rural economy secretary, Fergus Ewing, at Bute House in Edinburgh.
A spokeswoman for the Scottish government said: ""It was a good discussion and the first minister and Mr Ewing found the meeting with the commissioner to be very positive.""
The EU hands responsibility for paying out the money to national and regional governments, including Scotland - which is due to receive about £5.8bn in CAP Futures funding over the next six years.
The money is mainly given to improve agricultural productivity and to ensure farmers have a reliable source of income.
Farming union NFU Scotland has called on the Scottish government to ""get to grips"" with its ""calamitous"" attempts to distribute the money, with about a fifth of farmers still not having received anything.
The Scottish government has said it is keeping a tight rein on activity, costs and risks, to secure the best value it can for the taxpayer.
The government faces fines of between £40m and £125m if farmers are not paid by the 30 June deadline.
Speaking ahead of the meeting with Ms Sturgeon, Mr Hogan told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""Nobody wants to see uncertainty or instability at the moment in terms of farm income because markets are in a difficult situation at the moment, particularly in the dairy sector.
""We want to get money as quickly as we possibly can to farmers and we want to help Scotland to do so.""
NFU Scotland has criticised the complexity of the CAP system, and the ""fear"" that has built up over penalties incurred by accidental breaches of the rules.
Mr Hogan said he had attempted to simplify the ""complexity and bureaucracy"" of the CAP since becoming commissioner, and highlighted two initiatives in particular which he said would make it easier for farmers to get the money due to them.
These included a preventive preliminary check system, which sees officials look at initial applications and correct any minor mistakes to help farmers comply with the regulations.
And Mr Hogan also highlighted a ""yellow card system"" to reduce the penalties incurred for any unintentional errors, particularly for smaller farmers.
Mr Hogan addressed farmers at Ingliston on Thursday evening during an NFU Scotland debate on the EU referendum, where he backed the UK remaining in the EU, with former UK rural affairs secretary Owen Paterson putting forward the case for Brexit.
Speaking on the BBC's Today programme on Friday morning, Mr Hogan insisted that the EU's common agricultural policy was ""enormously beneficial to UK agriculture and food"" and generated an enormous amount of employment.
He said: ""If you're not in the single market - like what's advocated by the Leave Campaign - you would certainly have to renegotiate arrangements with the existing 27 Member States, and the 53 free trade agreements around the world that we have"".
But the Vote Leave campaign's agriculture spokesman, Huw Bell, told Good Morning Scotland that Prime Minister David Cameron had already said that support payments to farmers would continue even if the UK left the EU.
He added: ""If we look at countries in Europe that aren't in the EU, like Norway and Switzerland, they actually pay higher payments to their farmers.
""We would be able to actually save a lot of money. Britain in 2014 contributed £4.5bn to the Common Agricultural Policy, but we only got £2.9bn back.""","Phil Hogan, the EU's agriculture commissioner, discussed with Scottish government officials how to speed up payments to Scottish farmers under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).

To the outsider it looks like any other ageing factory. In the dank, strip-light lit interior there are rows of disused machines with cogs wrapped in cobwebs.
But three years ago the factory became the focus of the world's media, when it became apparent it was the last in the Palestinian Territories to produce the keffiyeh, the traditional Arab headdress and favourite of former leader Yasser Arafat.
The Palestinian keffiyeh industry had suffered a slump following market liberalisation measures under the 1993 Oslo Accords.
Wholesalers in the Palestinian Territories increasingly bought cheaper versions of the scarf from China, Jordan and Syria. A Hirbawi Textiles scarf costs around $6, while a Chinese keffiyeh costs as little as $3.
For loom worker Abdel Aziz El Taraki the move signalled the demise of the family run business.
Set up in 1961, the factory started with just two weaving machines, but as the headscarf became synonymous with Palestinian nationalism, demand quickly rose.
""Of course business used to be much better. We used to have 15 machines working and it wasn't enough, we sometimes had to work for 24 hours to cover the demand,"" says El Taraki.
""In the 1980s, during the first intifada, production was covering everywhere from Gaza to Jerusalem and Ramallah. Every imported keffiyeh sold here means one less sold for us.
""In the past we were doing very well, it then deteriorated until we only had two machines working in the factory.""
Following the media attention came a flood of inquiries about the factory.
Capitalising on the public's interest, the Hirbawi family set up an web page so orders from foreign countries could be placed.
Around the same time the story had caught the eye of the 'Young Professionals for Palestine', a group of internet activists based at the time in Kuwait.
Group founder Noora Kassem says they were concerned foreign imports were destroying the meaning of the Palestinian scarf.
""Globalisation has allowed cheaper products to be made in other countries that actually care nothing about the identity of the product itself and one of the things we were worried about was the fact that that mass production would take away from the authenticity of the product by ensuring it's not made in Palestine anymore,"" says Kassem.
""We felt like we had to mobilise to help the factory get more customers, and to get a larger client base and perhaps maybe improve its own capacities and its ability to get more machines.
""So what we did is we we made some sales by buying some keffiyehs, and sold them to people in Kuwait and tried to get more people to buy from the factory themselves.""
But despite the group's best efforts, the logistics of buying and selling the keffiyehs from Kuwait became problematic.
""We ended up setting up the Facebook page so that people could directly deal with the factory. The owner is very old and is a little bit resistant to changes in technology taking place and so hopefully adapting to those changes will take them into the new fold,"" she says.
""Of course we can't intervene and take their books and tell them how to do their business but we can help through marketing, through PR, through contacts and connectivity.""
With more than 1,000 members the Facebook page is proving very popular.
""We've got people all over the world from Australia to India to South Africa,"" says Kassem.
""All over the Middle East, Arabs and non-Arabs alike, interested in the message and exactly what the keffiyeh stands for.
""A lot of people associate it with a fashion accessory, but they were interested to find out what the history of it is and that this is the last factory and it came from Palestine.""
Jouda Hirbawi, one of two sons who looks after the day-to-day running of the factory, welcomes the Facebook page.
He says the site has had a direct impact on sales with up to 1,500 orders a month, mostly from America and Europe.  But despite its success he says the Palestinian Authorities should do more to help domestic industries.
""The Chinese use cheap materials and cheap labour, so the product that comes here is very cheap and there is no way to compete with it honestly,"" explains Jouda.
""Of course no country can ban imports, but there are ways to control them, for example, they should impose taxes on imported products.  This way they will support local producers who employ a lot of people. This will help the local economy as well.""
Production is currently up at the factory with eight machines producing more than 70 keffiyehs a day.
But with ageing technology and little evidence of investment in the factory's infrastructure, the Hirbawis will be aware they must do more or face the day when their looms fall silent.","The Hirbawi Textiles factory in the Palestinian Territories is the last in the region to produce the traditional Arab headdress, the keffiyeh. The factory's owner, Jouda Hirbawi, says that the move to liberalise the market under the 1993 Oslo Accords led to a decline in demand for locally produced keffiyehs, as cheaper versions could be bought from China, Jordan and Syria. The factory had two machines working when the story of its plight caught the media's attention, but since then it has seen a surge in orders from foreign countries, thanks in part to an internet campaign by a group of activists based in Kuwait. Despite this success, the factory's ageing technology and lack of investment in infrastructure mean that it may soon have to close down.</s>",mistral7b,XSUM,

Speaking to BBC Radio Manchester after the result was announced, Mr Lloyd spoke of ""great challenges"" for the region.
But he said they were challenges he was ""relishing"".

With two long-serving Greater Manchester Labour politicians in the running, it was perhaps easy to see why. For Tony Lloyd to have got the job is perhaps fortuitous - because his current role of police and crime commissioner will be subsumed into the mayoral role in 2017 anyway.

695,"The 121-turbine Navitus Bay project proved highly contentious with opponents claiming it would ""desecrate"" the Jurassic Coast and harm tourism in the area.
Supporters pointed to the benefits of renewable energy and jobs created in constructing and maintaining the turbines.
Earlier Lord Bourne, the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), announced development consent had been refused for the proposed project.
Here is some of the reaction.
""There's been a collective sigh of relief.
""We do tourism extremely well here - we don't do wind farms - this was the wrong location for it.
""Tourism is so important for Dorset.  This would have been a blight on the landscape.
""The majority of people were very much against it and there was huge concern that there would be a mass impact on tourism and that's our key industry here.""
""Navitus Bay was always too big, too close and threatened the very existence of England's only natural Unesco World Heritage Site.
""Yes, we need renewable energy sources for the future and already offshore wind generation forms a significant part of that, but to attempt to site it here, near some of the most highly designated coastline in England, would have been wilfully destructive... a more sensitive site is hard to imagine.
""Ultimately, I believe the threat to our Jurassic Coast, combined with damning research from Bournemouth Borough Council, which showed the wind farm could cost the area 5,000 jobs and £6.3bn in tourism revenue, swung the balance.""
Jonathan Bacon - Leader, Isle of Wight Council
""My reaction is one of disappointment - if this had been granted we'd have been looking at potential employment in support of the project from Yarmouth, as well as having the preferred supplier for the blades [MHI Vestas Offshore Wind] on the island.
""Those opportunities would seem to have been lost now. It will have some unfortunate effects for the island's economy.""
Mark Smith - Bournemouth Tourism
""I'm absolutely delighted - it's a decision about protecting the wonderful coastline which brings people from all over the world.
""It's very hard to overstate it - in this area tourism brings in over £1bn a year. Most of that comes from the attractiveness of the area so if you put that at risk, you put at risk 25,000 jobs.""
""It is ironic that this decision is made at a time when they have announced a range of applications for oil and gas exploration on the coast.
""Surely that's going to have more of an impact than this wind farm.
""Sadly this shows that the government is not genuinely committed to reducing our use of fossil fuels and climate change.
""I would like to think we would have a site like this somewhere along the coast but that is up to the developers.
""Wind alone is not the answer, we need to have a mix of other renewable sources of energy.""
""The Navitus Bay proposal was in one of the worst locations of all the new offshore wind farms and we are relieved that the government has refused to grant consent.
""With so many valid reasons for opposition, and unprecedented levels of objection, it would have been irrational to allow this scheme to proceed.
""We regret that so much time and effort has been put into examining a proposal that was clearly flawed from the outset and in a zone that should never have been included in the national offshore wind farm plan.
""We call on the developer to accept the government's decision and abandon its plans for good.""
""I have said from the very beginning that the Navitus Bay proposal would be bad for Bournemouth and bad for Dorset, threatening the UK's only natural World Heritage Site and the tourism economy which is the lifeblood of my constituency.
""I very much welcome the government's decision to refuse planning consent, which vindicates my own long-standing opposition to the proposal, as well as that of many of my constituents.
""I am delighted that our case has prevailed.
""The developer should take note that we will fight any appeal with equal resolve. This scheme must now be at an end and the threat to our area removed forever.""
""Not only will the UK be missing out on this important energy source but the development had enormous potential to bring hundreds of well-paid, highly-skilled jobs to an area that is dominated by low-pay.
""This decision means the UK is more reliant on non-renewable energy sources, including gas and oil from unstable countries overseas.
""This appears to be a politically motivated decision... the biggest threat to our beautiful coastline isn't from off-shore wind turbines but is from climate change, which we have already seen have a devastating impact on the South West coast line through serious storm damage.
""This decision is short-sighted and will only make the problem worse in the long-term.
""It's disappointing that the government aren't standing up for people who need this development but are caving in to those who shout the loudest.""
Speaking ahead of the decision, Mr Lynas said: ""The primary objections to this wind farm seemed to be aesthetic, not ecological.
""However the fact is that the UK needs large-scale clean energy developments like Navitus Bay if we are to meet our climate change targets.
""If offshore wind is rejected as an option, it will be extremely difficult to both get carbon emissions down and keep the lights on at the same time.""
""We live in a beautiful part of the country and tourism plays a huge part in our local economy.
""It is right that our famous coastline has been protected and I am sure this will be a big relief to many local people.
""I believe that we need a balanced energy policy but this scheme is simply in the wrong place.""
Speaking ahead of the decision, Ms Scott Cato said: ""We're obliged to reduce our carbon emissions and we simply don't have any way of providing the electricity and alternatives are much, much more expensive.
""It's going to be a blow to the security of our electricity supply and it's going to undermine the many jobs and skills that could be brought into the area, so I think it will be a very serious and very negative decision if we don't get permission for Navitus Bay to go ahead.""
""We always believed that this is the wrong proposal for this location and will lead to damage of a beautiful coastline.
""We commissioned our own study and found the wind park would negatively impact on these important landscapes and seascapes of nearby coastlines.
""Our objection was because of the impact on the beautiful coastlines of East Dorset and the Isle of Wight, including well-loved sites such as the Needles on the Isle of Wight, and Old Harry Rocks on Purbeck.
""However, the process for this development has also raised a number of other concerns which we would still like to see addressed.""","The Navitus Bay project, a proposed 121-turbine wind farm off the coast of Dorset, England, was rejected by the government due to opposition from local residents and environmental groups. The project was seen as a threat to the Jurassic Coast, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the local tourism industry. Supporters of the project argued for the benefits of renewable energy and job creation, but these arguments were not enough to overcome the opposition. The decision was welcomed by many, who saw it as a victory for protecting the natural beauty of the area.</s>",mistral7b,XSUM,

700,"And the advantage for girls' schools remains even when other factors are taken into account, such as social background or a selective intake.
Girls from poorer families in single-sex schools got better GCSEs than their counterparts in mixed schools.
The study showed much less advantage for boys in single-sex schools.
The high performance of girls in single-sex schools has been identified by education data analysts SchoolDash, in a breakdown of GCSE results published last week.
In terms of overall GCSE results, single-sex state secondary schools, about 11% of the total, performed much better.
In mixed schools, 55% of pupils got five good GCSEs including English and maths, while in single-sex schools the proportion was 75%.
Among these single-sex schools, girls' schools got better results.
But there are some underlying factors skewing these results, such as:
When these and other factors are taken into account, girls' schools still showed a clear advantage, with greater levels of ""value added"" in terms of pupils' progress and better results for poorer pupils.
The difference in like-for-like comparisons, the researchers say, was equivalent to girls' schools being three percentage points ahead of mixed ones.
Boys in single-sex schools were ahead of mixed schools in raw GCSE results, but they did not show a significantly better performance once other factors had been taken into account.
The analysis also showed single-sex schools were concentrated in London and the South East.
London's GCSE results were the best in England - and the study showed almost a third of secondary schools in the capital were single-sex, far higher than anywhere else.
Girls' schools in London did particularly well in this year's GCSEs - with single-sex schools in the capital an average 12 percentage points higher than their counterparts
The study described a ""halo"" of single-sex schools around the edge of London, including those in the independent sector and grammars.
There were other clusters, such as around Liverpool, but smaller numbers in northern England and the Midlands, and overwhelmingly in urban rather than rural settings.
Single-sex schools had a higher proportion of ethnic-minority pupils, but a lower than average proportion of deprived pupils, as measured by eligibility for free school meals.
Teachers in single-sex schools tended to be older, better paid and taking significantly less sick leave than their counterparts in mixed schools.
SchoolDash founder Timo Hannay said: ""It would now be interesting to try and understand why girls at girls' schools tend to do better than their peers, and what the vast majority of mixed schools might be able to learn from this phenomenon.""
Earlier this month, Richard Cairns, head of Brighton College, said girls at single-sex schools would be at a ""huge disadvantage"" if they could not feel confident talking to boys.
Single-sex schools were described as a ""deeply unrealistic world"".
But Caroline Jordan, president of the Girls' School Association, claimed the analysis of this year's results as a vindication of an all-girl education.
She said teachers with classes of girls could focus their teaching style on what worked best for girls.
""Girls are more collaborative, they like lessons to be more discussion-based,"" said Ms Jordan, who represents schools in the independent sector, where there is a long tradition of single-sex schools.
And an all-girl environment allowed them to ""escape gender stereotyping"", by, for example, encouraging more girls to pursue science subjects.
""Girls can be more confident in themselves, they don't have to become a particular type of girl, they're able to relax more,"" she said.
The claim girls in single-sex schools were more likely to study science was backed by long-term tracking studies, said Alice Sullivan, director of the Centre for Longitudinal Studies, at the UCL Institute of Education, in London.
""We found that girls from single-sex schools were more likely to take male-dominated subjects such as maths and science at school. Girls who had attended single-sex schools also had slightly higher wages than their co-ed peers in mid-life,"" said Prof Sullivan.
""People often make claims about the consequences of single-sex schooling for relationships between the sexes without referring to any evidence,"" she said.
""We found that women who attended single-sex schools were no more or less likely to marry than those in co-educational schools.""","Single-sex state secondary schools, particularly girls' schools, performed better than mixed schools in terms of GCSE results.

The ""unprecedented"" outbreak ""requires a huge global response"", she said.
It is the first time the DEC has sought funds over a disease outbreak.
The DEC - a group of 13 UK aid charities - said the public appeal for money is ""a sign of how serious the situation has become"".
Ebola has killed almost 5,000 people and infected more than 10,000 in West Africa since the start of the year.

The committee says £25 can provide cleaning kits including bleach, soap and a bucket for three families at risk from Ebola.
Basic protective clothing for three volunteers supporting people under quarantine can be provided for £50 and £100 can buy training for a community on how to keep itself safe from Ebola.
It comes as the World Health Organization (WHO) says there could be 5,000-10,000 new cases of the deadly virus every week in the worst affected countries by December. Infection rates continue to grow in Guinea and Sierra Leone.
However, there has been a decline in the spread of Ebola in Liberia - the country hardest hit in the outbreak - the WHO's Bruce Aylward said.
The new number of cases globally was 13,703, he said, adding the death toll, to be published later on Wednesday, would probably pass 5,000.
Mr Saeed also warned of other risks in West Africa as health workers focus on fighting Ebola.
He said: ""The health service in West Africa was virtually on the edge of collapse already. Now with the Ebola outbreak, unfortunately it means that other patients are not getting the care they need, whether it be pregnant ladies or those who have contracted HIV/Aids or malaria.""
In the US, two medical workers in Dallas, Texas, who treated a patient - who later died -  tested positive for Ebola but have been released from hospital after treatment.
Spanish nurse Teresa Romero was the first person to contract the virus outside West Africa. She was part of a team of about 30 staff at the Carlos II hospital in Madrid looking after two missionaries who returned from Liberia and Sierra Leone after becoming infected.
Germany, Norway and France and the UK have all treated patients who contracted the virus in West Africa.

707,"The wartime leader's image is planned to feature on the reverse of the new £5 note, together with one of his most celebrated quotations.
Churchill was chosen owing to his place as ""a hero of the entire free world"", said Bank governor Sir Mervyn King.
The current face of the £5 note is social reformer Elizabeth Fry.
A wide range of historical characters appears on the reverse of Bank of England banknotes, with Elizabeth Fry the only woman among the current crop.
The Bank of England governor has the final say about who appears on a banknote, although the public can make suggestions. The latest addition has been announced by Sir Mervyn at Churchill's former home of Chartwell, in Westerham, Kent.
Who is that on my banknote?
What was Sir Winston Churchill's legacy?
""Our banknotes acknowledge the life and work of great Britons. Sir Winston Churchill was a truly great British leader, orator and writer,"" Sir Mervyn said.
""Above that, he remains a hero of the entire free world. His energy, courage, eloquence, wit and public service are an inspiration to us all.""
Current plans, which the Bank said might be reviewed, are for Churchill to appear on the new £5 note to be issued in 2016.
The design includes a portrait of the former prime minister, adapted from a photograph taken by Yousuf Karsh on 30 December 1941. He is the only politician from the modern era to feature on a banknote.
The artwork will also include:
Sir Mervyn said that this was an appropriate choice given the country's economic difficulties.
""We do not face the challenges faced by Churchill's generation. But we have our own,"" he said.
""The spirit of those words remains as relevant today as it was to my parents' generation who fought for the survival of our country and freedom under Churchill's leadership.""
The Bank of England issues nearly a billion banknotes each year, and withdraws almost as many from circulation.
Notes are redesigned on a relatively frequent basis, in order to maintain security and prevent forgeries. Other security features include threads woven into the paper and microlettering.
The most recent new design from the Bank of England was the £50 note, which entered circulation in November. This features Matthew Boulton and James Watt who were most celebrated for bringing the steam engine into the textile manufacturing process.
While Bank of England notes are generally accepted throughout the UK, three banks in Scotland and four in Northern Ireland are authorised to issue banknotes.
Pharmacologist Sir Alexander Fleming, poet Robert Burns, and tyre inventor John Boyd Dunlop are among those who appear on these notes. One commemorative £5 note featuring football great George Best proved so popular that the limited edition of one million sold out in 10 days.
In May, a new five-euro note will be put into circulation by the European Central Bank.
It features an image of the Greek goddess Europa, which comes from a vase in the Louvre Museum in Paris.
The image of Churchill has featured on currency before.
He was the first commoner to be shown on a British coin when he appeared on the 1965 crown, or five shilling piece.
Churchill, elected as a Conservative MP in 1900, served as chancellor in Stanley Baldwin's government.
He replaced Neville Chamberlain to become the wartime British prime minister in May 1940 until 1945. He returned to office in 1951, and retired in 1955, aged 80.
""The Bank is privileged to be able to celebrate the significant and enduring contribution Sir Winston Churchill made to the UK, and beyond,"" said Chris Salmon, chief cashier of the Bank of England, whose signature will also appear on the banknote.
Sir Nicholas Soames, Churchill's grandson and MP for Mid Sussex, said: ""I think it is a wonderful tribute to him and an appropriate time. I can't think of any more marvellous thing that would have pleased him more.""
He described the move as a great honour for the family.","The new £5 note will feature Sir Winston Churchill, who is considered a hero of the entire free world.

Other data released with the gross domestic product (GDP) figure showed industrial output rising 8.8% in March from one year ago.
Retail sales for the month of March spiked by 12.2%, underscoring China's efforts to boost economic growth via domestic consumption.
Last year China set its growth target for 2014 at 7.5%, part of efforts to stabilise the economy after years of fast-paced expansion.
China's growth data is closely watched around the region. A slowdown could hurt Asian economies especially those which export commodities and industrial components to the world's second largest economy.
By Martin PatienceBBC News, Beijing
China's Premier, Li Keqiang, is trying to downplay the fixation on GDP figures in the world's second largest economy. He's now stressing that the quality, rather than the quantity, of growth is what is important.
China's leaders have said they will tolerate slower growth while they push through major economic reforms which are designed to create new, better-paying jobs. There is the realisation that the old economic model, dependent upon investment-led growth and exports, has now run out of steam.
The leadership wants to see more domestic consumption to create more sustainable growth over the long-term. It wants the private sector to play a bigger role. But in any economic shake-up, there will be winners and losers.
Implementing the reforms will mean tackling entrenched economic interests - such as state-owned enterprises - that have gobbled up resources and done very well out of the old way of doing things.
In recent weeks, the government has announced a mini-stimulus to prop up flagging growth. But it has ruled out the type of the massive stimulus which jolted China's economy back to life following the global financial crisis.
Despite the challenges, the governments hopes to post growth of around 7.5% for this year.
A sluggish start for the year is not uncommon, due to the Lunar New Year holiday when many businesses and factories shut down operations for about two weeks.
But recent data from the manufacturing as well as industrial sectors have been weak, raising fears of a prolonged slowdown.
Amid these concerns, China has recently taken more steps to give a jolt to its economy.
A mini-stimulus measure announced earlier this month will see Beijing extending a tax break for small and medium-sized companies, and ramping up spending on China's railway infrastructure.
In addition, the mainland also took steps to open up its capital markets by announcing a tie-up with Hong Kong, allowing for cross-border stock investment. The pilot scheme is scheduled to take off in about six months.
And in January, China launched a free-trade zone in Shanghai, seen as a test bed for reforms in key areas of the economy, such as the financial and telecom sectors which previously were tightly controlled by the government.
China also said it will allow foreign firms to make gaming consoles within the free-trade zone and sell them across China - lifting a ban on gaming consoles which had been in place since 2000.
Analysts are hopeful that the Chinese economy has bottomed out, and will perform better later in the year.
Julian Evans-Pritchard from Capital Economics said: ``Chinese growth held up better than expected last quarter and there are signs that downwards pressure on growth has eased somewhat.''
By Linda YuehChief business correspondent
""While Q1 GDP growth slowed, we believe that the growth momentum has stabilised in March. Port throughput data and our field study also suggest that China's trade may have bottomed out, and will become more resilient than what the current headline numbers suggest,"" said Zhou Hao who covers the Chinese economy for ANZ in Shanghai.
China's trade figures for March had shown a sharp drop in both imports and exports.

712,"The MUD coalition had been meeting for weeks to decide how to install a new government. It said it would pursue ""all constitutional means"" for change.
The MUD said this would include a recall referendum, a constitutional amendment and mass protests.
Venezuela is deeply divided between supporters of Mr Maduro's socialist government and those who oppose it.
Parties opposed to the governing socialist party won overwhelmingly in legislative elections held in December.
As a result, in January they took control of the National Assembly for the first time in 17 years.
Nevertheless, the executive branch remains under the control of President Maduro, whose term runs until 2019.
Many of the newly elected opposition lawmakers campaigned on a promise to replace the government before the end of Mr Maduro's term.
For the past weeks, MUD politicians had been discussing which strategy to pursue.
On Tuesday, MUD executive secretary Jesus Torrealba said the coalition would ""call on the Venezuelan people to launch the largest popular pressure movement that has ever existed to activate all - I repeat, all - mechanisms for change"".
The three options the opposition want to pursue are:
Under Venezuela's constitution, the president can be ousted by means of a referendum.
In order to trigger such a referendum, at least 20% of registered voters would have to sign a petition asking for a referendum. That would be 3.9 million voters.
But the referendum can only be called once the president has served half of this term.
As Mr Maduro started his six-year term on 19 April 2013, the opposition could start gathering signatures for a recall referendum after 19 April of this year.
For the referendum to be successful, an equal or greater number of voters than those who elected Mr Maduro would have to cast their vote in favour of the recall.
Mr Maduro won the 2013 election with 7,587,579 votes.
The opposition's plan is to introduce an amendment which shortens the presidential term from its current six years to just four with immediate effect.
That way, new elections would have to be held as early as December 2016.
Constitutional amendments can be proposed both by the National Assembly and through a petition signed by no fewer than 15% of registered voters.
Once the constitutional amendment is passed it has to be approved by the Venezuelan people in a referendum by a simple majority.
The MUD opposition coalition called on Venezuelans to take to the streets in the ""largest movement that has ever existed"" to force President Maduro to resign.
They stressed that protests should be peaceful and not descend into violence as happened in 2014, when 43 people from both sides of the political divide died during months of unrest which swept through Venezuela's major cities.
The opposition is counting on widespread discontent with Venezuela's dire economy to draw multitudes into the streets.
They called the first rally for Saturday 12 March.
Since the opposition gained control of the National Assembly it has been thwarted in its efforts to change laws by the Supreme Court.
First, three opposition lawmakers were barred from taking up office after the governing socialist party alleged irregularities.
This move deprived the opposition of its two-thirds majority, which would have given it the power to remove judges from the Supreme Court and create a constituent assembly with a view to rewriting the constitution.
More recently, the Supreme Court curtailed the power of the National Assembly to review government appointments of its judges.
Following these setbacks, the opposition is weary of the judiciary and reluctant to place all its eggs into one basket.
While on paper a recall referendum looks like the safest bet to bring about a change of government, the opposition fears this could be sabotaged by the National Electoral Council.
The signatures needed to trigger a referendum have to be collected within three days and then checked by the National Electoral Council, which the opposition says is packed with allies of President Maduro.
The opposition also fears that the electoral council could delay proceedings. The timing of the referendum is key because the eventual outcome could be very different depending on when it is held.
Under the constitution, if the president is recalled during his first four years in office, new elections are called,
However, if he is recalled in the last two years of his term, the vice-president takes over.
It is in the opposition's interest to have new elections, rather than have a socialist vice-president serve out Mr Maduro's term.
The opposition fears the Supreme Court, which is dominated by judges nominated by the socialist government, would derail a constitutional amendment aimed at shortening Mr Maduro's term.
It is also not clear how many people would support shortening the term of the president for good, as such a change would not only apply to Mr Maduro but to future presidents as well.
Some of the more moderate members of the opposition fear that mass protests may have an adverse affect.
If they turn violent, as they did in 2014, this strategy could lead to the jailing of many opposition activists.
They also say that President Maduro is unlikely to take much note of them as he has in the past dismissed those who oppose his government as ""imperialist stooges"".
More radical members of the opposition say that discontent with the government has grown since 2014 and that the numbers of people likely to protest would be much bigger and make it hard for Mr Maduro to ignore.","The MUD coalition in Venezuela is considering various strategies to remove President Nicolas Maduro from power, including a recall referendum, a constitutional amendment and mass protests.

715,"These bomb tests changed the level of carbon in the atmosphere, which can be traced to date elephant tusks.
Trafficking poached ivory is increasingly being used to fund civil wars, groups warn.
Scientists say the findings, published in PNAS, could make it easier to enforce the ivory ban.
The number of elephants being poached is now at the highest it has been for two decades, according to a UN backed report.
This was highlighted in January when a family of 11 elephants was slaughtered in Kenya, their tusks hacked off with machetes.
In the 1980s, more than half of Africa's elephants are thought to have been wiped out by poachers. This led to an international ban on trading ivory in 1989. As public awareness of the threat of extinction increased, the global demand for ivory dwindled.
But today conservationists believe that a growing demand for ivory in China and other Asian countries is responsible for a huge increase in the number of animals being poached.
Many governments have huge stockpiles of ivory, and it is often unclear when this ivory was acquired and whether or not some of it is leaking into the illegal market.
Now scientists have found that radioactive carbon in the atmosphere emitted during the Cold War bomb tests will make it easier to distinguish between illegal ivory to that which was acquired before the trade ban.
The amount of radiocarbon in the atmosphere nearly doubled during nuclear weapons tests from 1952 to 1962, which steadily dropped after tests were restricted to underground. This has been dubbed ""the bomb-curve"".
The levels have declined since but as they are still absorbed by plant, they enter the food chain and are measurable in plant and animal tissues.
The concentration of radiocarbon found in tiny samples of animal tissue can accurately determine the year of an animals death, from 1955 until today, explained lead author Kevin Uno from Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, US.
""This is different to the traditional dating technique which takes advantage of the loss of radiocarbon through time.""
Traditional radiocarbon dating would only be able to pick up an ""imperceptible amount of decay"" added Dr Uno, but because the bomb spike doubled the concentration or carbon, they were able to find huge variations over the last 60 years, which enabled accurate dating.
Dr Uno said this technique ""would dovetail very nicely with DNA testing which tells you the region of origin, but not the date"".
As anti-poaching funding is extremely limited, understanding where the poaching hotspots are, as well as how old the tusks are, could help the international community to direct funding to the places most at risk, he added.
""The year an elephant died plays a big role in whether or not the trade [of ivory] is legal. Poached ivory makes it to market relatively quickly, so by measuring the age of a tusk we can say what year it's from. This will help us pinpoint the source of the ivory and how it's getting to market.""
Big government organisations like the UN and Interpol have also recently increased efforts looking into the problem.
""Saving elephants - majestic and wonderful species - is priceless. These wildlife forensics are ready to roll, now we need to speak to the organisations who can set up a programme to make it happen.""
Poaching is a problem closely linked to poverty, politics and conflict. Poachers include poor opportunistic individuals and increasingly heavily armed militia groups who use ivory to fund conflicts.
WWF's regional East Africa manager Drew McVey welcomed the new research, and said any help in securing convictions could reduce ivory trafficking.
""The key thing to note is that ivory has been smuggled so far and wide, we've got to cut down the loopholes as much as we can. Though the amount of seizures [of illegal ivory] is increasing each year, we don't know how much we're catching, it's realistic to think we're not catching all the big ones.""
He added that poaching is not easy to prevent as ""one thing Africa isn't short of is poor people"" which is why it's important to cut down the ways people are moving ivory around.
""Rather than targeting people on the ground, we need to reduce the demand from middle men and the consumers,"" Mr McVey told BBC News.
As for the scientific process involved, Paula Raimer from Queen's University Belfast, said the study removes doubt that the C14 emitted from bombs can be used to date ivory.
""The work is of particular importance for forensics use in endangered species because the authors show that C14 can be used to determine the age of death or collection of ivory as well as establishing growth rates, so that other data from the teeth can also be put on a calendar time scale.""
The study has wider implications for crime forensics, she added, as bomb carbon could be used to date human bones as well as to detect art forgeries.","The study published in PNAS has found that radioactive carbon in the atmosphere emitted during Cold War bomb tests can be used to accurately date the death of elephants from 1955 until today.

It runs on the Android operating system, has a 5 megapixel camera, and up to 400 hours of stand-by battery life on a single charge - but it has only 8GB of internal memory and that, according to Mr Wood, is a red flag.
""I would be nervous about buying a device with less than 8GB memory - my experience is once you've installed a few apps you soon run out,"" he told the BBC.
""You are getting very basic functionality.""
Last week Chinese manufacturer OnePlus held the UK launch of its £239 handset, the OnePlus 2.
Like the previous model, the budget phone is marketed as ""invitation only"". Last year all 900,000 people who received an invitation got the phone.
Like the Vertu it has a 13 megapixel camera and the premium version, costing slightly more at £269, also has 64GB memory.
So how do the manufacturers keep their costs down?
Hugo Barra, a Vice President at budget Chinese electronics firm Xiaomi, told Tech Crunch that the secret for him lies in maintaining a small portfolio of products with a long shelf life.
Xiaomi has just two ranges of cheap phones - the Mi and Redmi.
""A product that stays on the shelf for 18 to 24 months - which is most of our products - goes through three or four price cuts. The Mi2 and Mi2s are essentially the same device, for example,"" he said.
""The reason we do these price cuts is because we've managed to negotiate component cost decreases [with our suppliers] over time.
""The importance of having a very small portfolio is significant — the fact that we only launch a few products each year, and (the fact that) we only have two product families.""
In November 2014 a research firm called Teardown took apart an Apple iPhone 6 and 6 Plus and estimated that the handsets cost the firm between £145 ($227) and £155 ($242) individually in terms of parts and assembly, reported Tech Insight.
And yet the cheapest iPhone 6 currently retails at £539 ($840) and the largest 6 Plus at £619 ($965) in the UK.
But it does not seem to be a deterrent - Apple reported another jump in profits last month, selling 47.5 million iPhones between April and June 2015 alone.
""People who have an iPhone are in love with the Apple experience,"" said Mr Wood.
Perhaps part of the reason why iPhone fans swallow the cost is pure convenience - moving away from Apple's notoriously locked down operating system can be frustrating.
""People who have gone from iPhone to Android find it a difficult experience,"" Mr Wood added.
""I've always said the iPhone is like the Hotel California of smartphones - once you're in it's difficult to leave.""
In an era of fears about hacking and data privacy, one of the biggest issues with cheaper phones is how safe they are.
Most budget smartphones run on the Android operating system, which is much less restricted than Apple's OS - and also more prone to hacks.
""Cheap phones are not a bad thing - the cost of hardware is always dropping - but the security is really reliant on the software,"" said security expert Prof Alan Woodward from Surrey University.
Cheaper devices can be more difficult to update with essential patches issued by the operating system to tighten security, he added.
""It's not that the technology prevents it but rather that the vendors tend not to issue the necessary updates,"" he said.
""We've seen it for years with cheap routers where a flaw is found it is just not economic for a manufacturer to issue firmware updates for a device worth £32 ($50).
""If something is too good to be true it probably is. If you find you can buy a well-featured smartphone from some unknown supplier for pennies then you have to assume that you are the product and someone is likely to be harvesting data about you (for criminal purposes or other).""","The article discusses the idea of whether you get what you pay for when it comes to smartphones.

The charity, which is treating nearly 6,000 veterans for conditions such as PTSD, said it expected numbers to rise as the Syrian conflict develops.
In 2014 the government said it was investing Â£7.4m to improve services.
RAF air strikes are continuing in Syria after British forces joined allied operations to target so-called Islamic State militants in the country.
But Combat Stress warned it might not be able to afford to support veterans affected by the conflict in the future.

In the last financial year referrals to the charity for conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression went up by nearly 25% from 1,819 in 2013-14 to 2,328 in 2014-15.

720,"Under the proposals, tenants would be asked to sign an agreement not to light up inside their home.
President of the Faculty of Public Health, Prof John Middleton, says some councils and housing associations are already exploring the smoke-free housing idea.
According to the professor, the agreement would be voluntary rather than mandatory, although it would be part of the tenancy contract for new family housing.
He says there would be tenants who would prefer to live in a non-smoking block, particularly if they have children.
Second-hand smoke harms children's lungs and has been linked to an increased risk of cot death in babies.
""We are not saying people can't smoke or that they have to give up smoking. The voluntary agreement would be that they have to smoke outside.""
It would be up to social landlords and housing associations to set the rules. Anyone living in the smoke-free building who signed up would then need to abide by the arrangements.
The US has decided to go a step further and insist all public housing agencies provide smoke-free environments for their residents by the end of July 2018
It will means no-one can smoke inside or within 25 feet of the homes.
Policymakers think so, although it can be difficult to measure the full impact.
A ban on smoking in public places, including restaurants and bars, was introduced in England in 2007.
The government then commissioned a review of the evidence on the impact of the law in England. This was carried out by Prof Linda Bauld from the University of Stirling and the UK Centre for Tobacco Control Studies.
Prof Bauld's report, published in 2011, concluded there had been ""benefits for health"" as well as changes in attitudes and behaviour, with more people looking to cut down on or quit smoking.
According to the charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), the majority of people who live in social housing in the UK do not smoke and many of those who do already act responsibly and take their smoke outside.
A spokeswoman said: ""Blanket bans are unlikely to be the answer but it would be great to see social landlords thinking strategically about how they can support healthier environments around smoking.
""Looking at new housing and setting some aside for smoke-free tenancies seems like a sensible suggestion and it would be great to see landlords adopt this as part of a wider approach.""
Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, said banning smoking in social housing would set a very dangerous precedent.
""Not only would it be a gross invasion of privacy, it would penalise unfairly those who can't afford to buy their own homes.
""How would the policy be enforced? It could create a snooper's charter allowing people to snitch on neighbours, especially those they don't get on with. Children might inadvertently give their parents away, resulting in possible eviction.
""It's not second-hand smoke that's making people's lives a misery. It's puritanical bodies like the Faculty of Public Health who, having campaigned to ban smoking in every pub and club in the country, are now trying to dictate how people behave in their own private space as well.""","The document discusses the proposal for smoke-free housing, where tenants would be asked to sign an agreement not to light up inside their home.

722,"According to the New York Times, US foreign allies ""were blindly dialling in to Trump Tower"" in the days after the national election.
Further upset was caused when Mr Trump announced he had spoken directly to the Taiwanese president, Tsai Ing-wen, even though formal relations between the US and Taiwan were cut almost 40 years ago at China's behest.
But what is normal procedure for conversations between world leaders? Here are some of the steps taken to smooth out the process and avoid potential pitfalls, from linguistic misunderstandings to prank callers.
""Hello, can I speak to the president?"" is not an off-the-cuff request an operator is ever likely to hear from a world leader.
By the time the initial pleasantries are exchanged between heads of state, the groundwork will have been done behind the scenes by the leaders' respective staff.
""When there is an established relationship between two countries, it might be as simple as one situation room calling its counterpoint and saying my head of state wants to speak to yours,"" says Stephen Yates, who worked as deputy national security adviser to former US Vice-President Dick Cheney.
When countries are in less frequent contact, an ambassador may make the first formal request on their leader's behalf. They will set out the proposed agenda and reasons for the call and, if agreed, the reciprocal team would then work it into busy schedules.
World leaders are typically well briefed before speaking to each other.
In the US, the president is given a dossier from the National Security Council (NSC), the principal US advisory body on national security and foreign policy.
If it is a simple courtesy call, the information provided may be basic, including details on who initiated contact, and two or three recommended talking points. There may also be some need-to-know personal information, such as a reminder to ask after a sick husband or wife.
If the topic is sensitive, the NSC will offer the president an additional short briefing, and then listen in on the call.
World leaders usually have various people listening in on their conversations, including aides and interpreters.
Even when leaders speak another language fluently, they often choose to conduct official calls in their mother tongue.
""Sometimes that is down to national pride, but it's also to avoid misunderstandings and protect nuance,"" says Kevin Hendzel, a former White House linguist.
US presidential translators will have passed security clearances, background checks and even sat polygraph tests, before they become privy to sensitive information involved in high-level diplomacy.
""There are no novices that work at the presidential level,"" says Mr Hendzel. ""It takes a great deal of time for an interpreter to reach this stage. They are also experts in the subject matter, and they know getting a form of address wrong can be a deal breaker.""
""It's apples and oranges when you are comparing transitional calls by a president-elect to those of a head of state in the Oval Office,"" says Mr Yates.
Once Mr Trump is in the hot seat, all his calls will be highly secure and heavily vetted.
""The president will feel like he has just picked up the phone, like any other call, but the call will have been through multiple checks to ensure its fidelity,"" says Mr Yates.
Sometimes this vetting process can be so tight, the wrong people get cut off. ""I am fighting w[ith] the WH [White House] operator who doesn't believe I am who I say,"" wrote exasperated Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a 2010 email.
Prank calls to presidents are rare, but not unheard of.
Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy fell victim to hoax in January, when a radio presenter phoned imitating the new separatist leader of Catalonia.
In 2003, a US radio station based in Miami scored the double, when it tricked both the then Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and his close ally, the former leader of Cuba, Fidel Castro.
Radio El Zol first called Chavez, pretending to be Castro, and then called Castro masquerading as Chavez. When the Cuban realised he had been tricked, he unleashed a torrent of swearwords.
Different radio DJs have also fooled Evo Morales, when he was Bolivia's president-elect in 2005 (pretending to be then Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero), and the Queen (pretending to be Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien in 1995).
The Moscow-Washington hotline, often referred to the ""red telephone"", is a special, highly secure system that allows direct communication between the leaders of the United States and Russia.
""Contrary to the myths, it's not actually a phone,"" explains Kevin Hendzel, who worked as senior technical linguist on the project in the 1980s.
The line, used to send text and images (maps, diagrams etc), was developed after the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, when the two countries came close to a nuclear war.
It remains an open channel, allowing instant communication if needed. ""Because when it comes to nuclear missiles, everything is measured in minutes,"" says Mr Hendzel.","The New York Times reported that US foreign allies ""were blindly dialling in to Trump Tower"" after the national election.

The three points were duly delivered on an afternoon of tension on Tyneside, courtesy of Moussa Sissoko's header early in the second half that sent a thunderous roar around the stadium in an outpouring of elation and sheer relief.

And, in a fitting moment high on emotion, Jonas Gutierrez added a second late on - a goal ecstatically received, not simply for its significance in the context of the Premier League but also because the Argentine is a hugely popular figure after returning to the side in March following treatment for testicular cancer.
Newcastle's fans rejoiced in the result that ensured they will be in the Premier League next season while manager John Carver, who has had such a miserable time since succeeding Alan Pardew at the turn of the year, could at least have the consolation of not being the man to take this giant of a club down.
For West Ham counterpart Allardyce, this was a miserable conclusion to his stay at Upton Park.
Allardyce has done a presentable job at West Ham, getting them promoted to the Premier League and consolidating their position, but he remained an unloved figure among their fans and this was no fond farewell as he was roundly abused by thousands of travelling supporters once Newcastle went ahead.
Even in the moments of joy that followed the final whistle, Newcastle fans swiftly turned their attention to their unpopular owner Mike Ashley, with resounding chants of ""Get Out Of Our Club"" - a wish it seems he has no intention of granting.
Ashley gave a rare interview before kick-off, insisting he would not sell and would remain in charge until they won a trophy - but for now survival equals success for a club that has slumped so spectacularly since the turn of the year.
The scale and significance of the occasion could be measured in the number of Newcastle fans gathered around St James' Park hours before kick-off in anticipation of what Carver described as the club's biggest game for six years.

In a noisy, tense atmosphere Newcastle almost got the perfect start inside two minutes when Emmanuel Riviere made space inside the area but flashed an effort across goal.
Riviere was also just off target with an acrobatic bicycle kick before West Ham settled down and started to play on the nerves of everyone inside the famous old stadium.
Tim Krul needed to be alert to block low down from Stewart Downing as the Hammers demonstrated that they were not on Tyneside simply to usher Newcastle to safety.
Newcastle picked up the pace once more at the start of the second half and after Riviere had missed another good chance, failing to connect with Daryl Janmaat's cross from six yards out, the breakthrough the whole of Tyneside craved arrived after 54 minutes.
Gutierrez provided an inviting cross to the far post where Sissoko rose highest to head low past keeper Adrian to spark an outpouring of joy and noise that could have been heard on the nearby Tyne Bridge.
After Vernon Anita wasted a perfect opportunity to at least afford the Newcastle fans some relaxation, Gutierrez stepped in to add the second.

727,"Local councillors and some MPs say mayors for three rural parts of England will add an expensive and unwanted extra tier of government.
Councils could reject the idea and opt out of new authorities in Lincolnshire, the west of England and East Anglia, North Somerset MP Liam Fox said.
The government says it wants to help the local economy and devolve power.
Some Conservative councillors in the rural areas intend to try to block the policy, which will not be imposed on unwilling areas.
In his Budget in March, Chancellor George Osborne announced plans for elected mayors in the three areas.
Local authorities will vote on whether or not to accept detailed proposals by the end of June.
North West Norfolk MP Sir Henry Bellingham, said people would feel no affinity to a new authority and elections for a new mayor would attract a ""pathetic"" turnout.
He told the Today programme on Radio 4: ""Now I don't want a regional leader coming along and saying look 'Henry you've been a bad boy, I gather you don't want this incinerator, you don't want these houses, well actually the region do want it and I'd like you to have it'.
""That is going to put MPs in a very difficult position and change their constitutional position.""
While he supported the idea of devolution, he said plans for a new mayor should be put on hold.
A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) said it was making ""huge progress"" in making local areas more powerful by devolving power from Whitehall.
A source close to the chancellor said: ""The devolution revolution taking place across the country has unstoppable momentum behind it.""
Six new authorities, which will have elected mayors, have been established in mainly urban areas, with another expected this summer.
Conservative sceptics argue the plans will not work in rural areas.
Passing extra powers to large authorities with accountable, high-profile mayors is one of the Mr Osborne's central aims.
Privately, some Conservatives have compared it to the government's attempt to turn all English schools into academies, accusing it of forcing the plan on reluctant councils.
One said councils had been ""bribed and bullied"" in a bid to make them accept the idea.
But a DCLG spokesman said: ""The government is making huge progress towards rebalancing the economy and empowering local areas through the devolution of powers and resources away from Whitehall to local people.
""Ministers have been repeatedly clear that devolution is a genuinely bottom-up process  - all proposals are agreed by local leaders, and the government will not impose an arrangement on any area.""
Chris Skidmore, the Conservative MP for Kingswood near Bristol, said he supported the idea, and a new West of England mayor would create a ""powerhouse in the south"".
Directly-elected mayors would be put in place, he said, even if some authorities chose not to take part. He said: ""If one council decides they don't want to do a deal, the other three will go ahead with the same pot of money given to those three councils.""
Peterborough MP Stewart Jackson, who has secured a House of Commons debate on the topic, said politicians would not give the government a ""blank cheque"" to sign up for more local government with a weak mayor.
He said: ""It's not something when you're talking of spending hundreds of millions of pounds over the next 30 years that any responsible elected politician accountable to their electorate can sign up to.""
North East Somerset Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg is also opposed.
The leader of the Conservative group on Norfolk County Council, Cliff Jordan said he thought the council would reject the policy.
The Labour leader of the Council George Nobbs supports the idea of devolution but also opposes the policy in its current form.
Cambridgeshire County Council, which has a Conservative leader, has already voted to oppose the plan as it stands.
The Local Government Association wants local areas to be able to accept new powers and extra funding offered by the Treasury without having elected mayors.

It's a journey that more fashion firms are beginning to take, with the so-called ""circular economy"" - which eliminates waste by turning it into something valuable - being seen as a possible solution to the vast amount of clothes that end up in landfill.
Last year, a fifth of the material H&M used was sustainably sourced, and it has gathered 32,000 tonnes worth of old clothing in the collection bins it has had in all its stores since 2013. The move was aimed at keeping the garments out of landfill, where three-fifths of clothing ends up.
H&M's sustainably sourced material makes up the equivalent of 100 million t-shirts - yet that is still a mere fraction of the Â£18bn worth of clothes it sold last year.
It's easy to accuse them of ""green washing"" - spending more time talking up their eco credentials than actually changing how they do things.
After all, aren't fast fashion and sustainability simply incompatible?
""We believe that you can be both and we are using our size and scale to do good,"" says Catarina Midby, H&M's UK sustainability manager.
Asked if the solution is that people buy less she says it's ""perfectly possible"", but adds: ""We cannot influence what people choose to spend their money on and we need to be profitable to drive fashion sustainability. Circularity is a key solution to the negative impact of consumption.""
The firm is investing in textile recycling innovations and research, but currently, most clothes which involve a blend of materials such as polyester, nylon and cotton, are impossible to separate and recycle.
None of the clothes the firm produced last year were 100% recycled. As Ms Midby says the firm ""is only at the beginning of our journey"".
Clothing sales are continuing to rise around the world, particularly among the growing middle class in emerging market economies.
Globally the number of garments produced exceeded 100 billion for the first time in 2014, nearly 14 items of clothing for every person on earth.
Yet from the water and pesticides required to grow things such as cotton, to the chemicals and energy - mostly fossil fuels - involved in the manufacturing process, to our overflowing landfills, it's wreaking havoc environmentally.
""Overconsumption is the elephant in the room. We know it's a problem but we don't want to do anything about it,"" says Dr Helen Roby, a researcher at the Open University.
Her recent wardrobe audit project found people vastly underestimated the number of clothes they owned.
Felix Poza, director of sustainability at Zara-owner Inditex, the world's biggest fashion retailer, says producing quality new fibres out of recycled garments is one of the sector's most important challenges.
It is currently working with Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)  and several Spanish universities on potential solutions, and claims sustainability is at the heart of all its decisions. For example, unusually it doesn't advertise and it says it analyses demand to minimise waste.
Ultimately, he says, ""To generate profit in the long term means operating in a sustainable way.""
It is this fear that the supply of natural resources involved in production, for example water, could become more scarce, which is most likely to force change.
""If you operate in the lower end of the market where cost is absolutely key then an increase in the raw material price is absolutely disastrous,"" says Geoff Lane, a partner at PwC.
Rien Otto, the founder and chief executive of Dutch Awearness, believes small firms like his offer a solution.
The firm started in 2012 as an EU-funded project to see if it was possible to make fabric that could be completely recycled.
The result from its collaboration with weavers was a polyester material that it now uses to make protective workwear, uniforms and suits.
When they're worn out or discarded, the material used to make them can be completely broken down and made into something else. Crucially, he says the price for the fabric is comparable to conventional materials, and lowers both water use and CO2 emissions.
Ultimately he wants to ""lease"" rather than sell its clothes, but currently it sells directly to other businesses, from whom it collects used clothing in exchange for a discount on future purchases.
Due to the scannable label it puts in each garment, which contains information on all the raw materials used in its creation, the customer knows exactly how to break the materials back down.
The firm is targeting â‚¬86m (Â£77m; $95m) in sales next year, but no-one is doing this kind of recycling on a commercial scale.
Mr Otto believes small firms will blaze the trail: ""It's very easy for us to do research and development and bring in innovation. We can then work together with big companies to bring in solutions.""
Yet it remains tough for smaller firms offering a sustainable alternative.
People Tree, founded by Safia Minney over 25 years ago, was a pioneer in the sector, offering organic cotton and using production methods that minimised environmental impact long before it was fashionable.
Her desire was to show that it was possible to do fashion in a different way, while helping disadvantaged communities.
The firm made a loss last year and she says there is still very little capital for emerging ecological fashion brands trying to grow.
She believes the government should not charge VAT ""on fair trade, ethical and sustainable products from the developing world as a way of levelling the playing field"".
But she also says consumers need to think about where they're buying from.
""Use shopping as a vote. If your favourite brand isn't ethical, put pressure on them to disclose information. In the first world we have a voice and not to use it is disgraceful,"" she says.","The High Street group, which owns brands including Monki and Cos, has pledged to become ""100% circular"" and use only recycled or sustainable materials to make its clothes. The move is seen as a possible solution to the vast amount of clothes that end up in landfill. However, the firm is currently only at the beginning of its journey and most of the clothes it produced last year were not 100% recycled.

Back in December, McLaren chairman Ron Dennis talked about wanting to repeat the success of the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the team won the drivers' and constructors' titles for four successive years from 1988.
But there is no comparison between the new McLaren-Honda and the old one.
When the two joined forces in 1988, Honda's turbo had been established as the best engine in F1 for at least two years and had been racing for five. The 2015 Honda turbo engine - with the hybrid technology now part of F1 - raced for the first time on Sunday.
The McLaren-Honda was the slowest car in Australia by a massive margin.
Button and team-mate Kevin Magnussen were 1.5 seconds away from getting out of the first knockout stage of qualifying.
On paper, they were 2.9secs slower than Mercedes in that session. But given the world champions were on the slower tyre, a further second can be added to that gap.
Media playback is not supported on this device
That's without considering the extra power Mercedes would gain from turning up their engine progressively for the next two parts of qualifying.
Three seconds off the pace each lap is bad enough, but five is close to catastrophic. And it raises the very real question of whether McLaren-Honda can ever close that gap.
Even McLaren racing director Eric Boullier admitted that ""it may take more than a couple of years to catch up"".
So what has gone wrong and can it be fixed?
The main reason is the engine. It only takes a glance at the speed trap figures to see that. McLaren are right at the bottom and were a massive 14-15km/h slower than the pace-setting, Mercedes-powered Williams.
Button was 15.5km/h slower than the Williams of Felipe Massa at the start-finish line, but only 14.8km/h down at the speed trap situated before the braking zone at the end of the straight.
This strongly suggests that the hybrid part of the engine is where the major problem lies, for it is with punch out of corners that the electrical energy plays the biggest part in performance.
The hybrid part of an F1 engine - recovering energy from both the rear axle (the MGU-K) and turbo (the MGU-H) - can account for anything between 160-200bhp, depending on how effective the technology is at recovering energy from the turbo, which is unlimited.
Media playback is not supported on this device
F1 engineers have a formula for working out what a lap-time deficit is equivalent to in terms of horsepower. This is, on average, 0.016secs per bhp.
So 2.9secs down is equivalent to 181bhp; 3.9secs is 244bhp; 5secs is 312bhp.
Now, not all the McLaren-Honda's deficit to the Mercedes will be down to the engine, so somewhere in amongst those numbers is how far the Honda is down on the Mercedes engine.
The real number is said to be at least 200bhp - equivalent, in effect if not in reality, to the whole hybrid part of the engine simply not working, and then some.
An ineffective hybrid system also requires the internal combustion element of the engine to be turned down, otherwise it would use too much fuel, as there is less power available from electrical energy.
Honda's main problem is that the engine is too unreliable to run at full power - and in Australia it had to be turned down even further than planned because the company did not have enough confidence in its ability to sustain the higher temperatures than were seen in pre-season testing in a southern European winter.
Describing the engine settings as ""very conservative"", Honda F1 boss Yasuhisa Arai said: ""Unfortunately we don't have the experience of higher temperatures so we could not risk losing the engine in the first race.""
Both the MGU-K and the engine itself were reduced in output, he said.
Despite that, Kevin Magnussen's engine did fail on the way to the grid. Honda say they do not yet know whether that engine, which comes out of Fernando Alonso's allocation of four for the season, is a write-off.
How much more power the engine will have once Honda becomes more confident in its reliability is not known.
The indications are that Honda know what the problems are, but the team refuse to put a timetable on how long they will take to fix.
In its quest to improve performance, Honda has the added benefit that, although engine development is restricted, manufacturers have freedom to change parts beyond the limits set by the rules if it is for reliability purposes. So there is room for manoeuvre.
It has occurred to many that the shrink-wrapped, tightly designed rear end of the McLaren - what they call their ""size-zero car"" - might be an influencing factor in the reliability issues Honda is suffering. But the team insist that is not the case.
Even if the engine is something over 200bhp down on the Mercedes, that still leaves a deficit of anywhere between a second and a second and a half in the car.
The McLaren drivers have been complimentary about the way the car behaves so far, and Button said the car was ""about equal"" to the Red Bull and Sauber in the corners.
But that's not exactly encouraging - one is, well, a Sauber; and Red Bull have massive problems with the driveability of the Renault engine, which is badly holding back its cornering performance.
However, Button, team-mate Kevin Magnussen and racing director Eric Boullier are confident the MP4-30 provides a good base for development.
Its design marks a philosophical shift for McLaren. For years, the team have chased peak downforce, with the result that the car is unpredictable and difficult to drive in corners because the downforce levels were inconsistent.
Aerodynamic design in F1 cars is a compromise. The more downforce a team chases from, say, a front wing, the more likely that part is to 'stall' - suddenly lose downforce because the airflow is disrupted. This is called ""peaky"" downforce and is what was happening to McLarens in the last few years.
Now, they have changed to a more Red Bull-style of philosophy, of aiming for more consistent, stable aerodynamics, which allow the driver to have more confidence, and therefore push harder.
""Last year,"" Button says, ""the car had a lot of downforce initially when you hit the brakes but it was very on the nose on turn-in, and when you turned in you lost all front end at apex, whereas this year it does what you hope it will do, so you can be precise.
""It is a good start. We don't have enough downforce to fight with the Mercedes [if we had the same power], for example, or even a couple of other teams. But the basic philosophy is definitely right. I have not driven a McLaren like this before, not in the way it works.
""I'm not saying it's the quickest McLaren I've ever driven, because it's not. But in the way it works the basic car is very good so it means you can build on it.
""The airflow is very clean so you can just add downforce whereas before you added downforce and it would change the characteristics of the car. But it still needs a lot of work to be competitive.""
Boullier adds: ""What we know is the car is already good compared to last year's but we also know that the aero or vehicle dynamics development we can bring on this car in the next months is massive.""","The McLaren-Honda partnership has not started well in F1 with the car being the slowest in Australia by a massive margin. The hybrid part of the engine is the main reason for the deficit with the Mercedes, with the Honda engine being at least 200bhp down on the Mercedes. The team is confident that the car provides a good base for development and is working on improving the aerodynamics and vehicle dynamics.</s>",mistral7b,XSUM,

PGA president Andrea Albutt ""cautiously"" welcomed the move but said it must be done in a ""safe and staged"" way as 80% of prisoners smoked.
The Ministry of Justice said safety and security remained its ""top"" priorities.
The government intends to ban smoking in all 136 prisons in England and Wales to reduce health risks - it is currently allowed only in prison cells and exercise yards.
The move follows a series of legal challenges by prison officers and inmates who have complained about the effects of passive smoking.
Mrs Albutt, who has governed four prisons, most recently Bristol, is heading a team that will be implementing the changes.
The privately run Parc Prison, in south Wales, is expected to go smoke-free next year, and publicly-run jails in Wales and south-west England are likely to follow.
Speaking on behalf of the Prison Governors Association, Mrs Albutt said the organisation agreed with the ban but said it had to be done in a managed and gradual way to avoid unrest, as about 80% of prisoners were smokers.
Stopping them smoking could result in ""stability issues"", she told BBC News, in her first interview since becoming the organisation's president on an interim basis.
She added that banning tobacco would create ""potential problems"" because it risked turning it into an illicit item to be smuggled in and traded by prisoners as ""currency"".
Joe Simpson, assistant general secretary for the Prison Officers Association, compared the effects of passive smoking on prison officers with the risks posed to bar workers before smoking in pubs was banned.
""All we are asking is for something that will help protect our members,"" he said.
A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ""We are continuing to consider how to reduce the prevalence of smoking across the prison estate but the safety and security of prisons will always be our top priority.""
Razor Smith, who served three decades in prison for a spate of armed robberies, said:
I served time in a juvenile prison in the 70s where there was no smoking and I can tell you... there was a great black market in tobacco goods.
There's a black market in anything, in any banned goods.
Whether you like it or not, tobacco is a way of dealing with stress and a lot of prisoners smoke.
If you were to take it away from them, after they've had it for so many years, it becomes like a war of attrition with the prison system and they then see the prison system as taking something away that is legitimate, that you're allowed to do outside - and obviously there will be violence.
They tried it in Australia a couple of weeks ago I think and there was an immediate riot.
Scotland is also considering tighter restrictions on smoking in jails.
The Scottish Prison Service said it aimed to have plans in place by December 2015 on how indoor smoke-free prison facilities would be delivered.
But the Northern Ireland Department of Justice said it had no plans to change the current rules, under which smoking is permitted in prison cells and certain open spaces.
Mrs Albutt, the first woman to lead the Prison Governors Association since it was founded 28 years ago, said the current priority of governors was to address the problems caused by new psychoactive substances (NPS), sometimes referred to as ""legal highs"" - synthetic drugs that mimic the effects of cannabis, ecstasy and cocaine.
""The problem is... an epidemic across the prison estate. As such it needs to be tackled strategically,"" she said, adding that many offenders would not be able to engage in education and training until prisons were clear of the ""mind-altering"" drugs.
The Ministry of Justice acknowledged the ""huge challenge"" posed by NPS and agreed it had to be tackled before preparing offenders to lead better lives.
The move has prompted debate on both sides of the argument:","The government plans to ban smoking in all 136 prisons in England and Wales to reduce health risks.

Hashim Amla, Dean Elgar and Faf du Plessis all passed 50 as the tourists eventually declared on 343-9 in their second innings.
Set 474 to win, England were given four overs to survive at the end of the day.
Alastair Cook was given out lbw first ball, but successfully overturned the decision on review to see the home side close on 1-0.
Media playback is not supported on this device
England's bowling was largely respectable, with Moeen Ali taking 4-78 and Ben Stokes 2-34.
Their day might have been better had a caught-behind appeal against Amla been reviewed when he was on 25, while Elgar was dropped by a flying James Anderson on 55.
Ultimately, Joe Root's side paid the price for being bowled out for 205 in their first innings, and the four-match series is likely to be levelled at 1-1.
Following the high of a 211-run victory at Lord's a week ago, this was a chastening day for England, who have to pull off a Test record run chase if they are to secure an unlikely victory.
The surface offered less assistance to the pace bowlers than the first two days, but the home side would not have been pleased to see examples of the ball keeping low late on.
Tactics were occasionally imaginative - the off side packed or leg-side catchers employed for the short ball - and the bowling wholehearted, even if paceman Mark Wood again looked innocuous in 18 wicketless overs.
But most of England's efforts were repelled by a South Africa side who demonstrated all the patience, discipline and application that eluded the hosts on day two.
It was Amla (87) who epitomised South Africa's relentless accumulation, only bursting to life at the sight of Liam Dawson, hitting the left-arm spinner down the ground.
Still, it was Dawson who removed Amla, correctly reviewing a rejected lbw appeal after the right-hander advanced down the pitch.
Elgar (80) earlier shared a stand of 135 with Amla, but the left-hander showed no great fluency before he was bounced out by Stokes.
England chipped away, but the compact Du Plessis (63) was another to show restraint until he was trapped by a Stokes delivery that scuttled through.
Off-spinner Moeen benefited as the visitors accelerated towards a declaration, claiming his fourth wicket by holding a return catch from Vernon Philander (42), who had just hoisted two massive leg-side sixes from successive balls.
Root, in his second Test as captain, has experienced problems with the Decision Review System, seeing two referrals wasted on the first day after pressure from bowlers Stokes and Stuart Broad.
That was probably the explanation for his reluctance to use a review after Broad's muted appeal for an Amla edge behind was rejected. Subsequent replays showed the faintest nick.
In Broad's following over, Anderson, at gully, leapt high and thrust out his left hand, but failed to cling on to the chance offered by Elgar.
Later, Cook was correct to challenge when given out leg before to Morne Morkel, with the ball-tracker suggesting it was going over the top of the stumps,
Still, he and opening partner Keaton Jennings each had a further appeal to survive in a testing period before the close.
England bowling coach Ottis Gibson: ""It is a great game to win from here. You have to give a lot of credit to South Africa. There was a lot of character shown not just by our bowling unit but the fielders.
""The captain said he wanted people to step up and Anderson came in and led really well this morning. Wood has not got any wickets but bowled really well in patches coming off the back of a long lay-off and Stokes was fantastic today.
""It has been a very tough couple of days but we have two days to make 474.""
Ex-England batsman Ed Smith: ""The groundsman here at Trent Bridge reckons the pitch will get flatter the more the sun comes out. Let's hope for England's sake he is correct.
""There were some ominous signs late on with Vernon Philander swinging the ball round but England battled through a horrible period without loss.""
Former England spinner Graeme Swann: ""England should be thinking they can chase this. Joe Root is a positive lad and will think it's chaseable. I played in a game where India chased 380-4 against us in Chennai.
""Joe has very little captaincy experience but in a game where he led Yorkshire, Middlesex knocked off 480. I think Hampshire did something similar to him too. He'll be thinking if they can do it to my team, I'll do it to somebody else's.""","England were given four overs to survive at the end of the day and managed to close on 1-0.

746,"The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Scotland called for a promised extra £500m for GPs and health centres to have a ""sharper focus"" in order to bring about change.
The increased funding was announced at the SNP conference last October.
The government said it was ""determined to tackle health inequalities"".
Health Secretary Shona Robison pointed to a ""links worker"" programme, which will be extended following a pilot in deprived areas of Glasgow and Dundee.
The government-funded scheme provides a dedicated worker in GP surgeries who helps people with issues of poverty, debt and isolation which are making them feel unwell.
RCGP Scotland chairman Dr Miles Mack said the additional investment offered ""a major opportunity to invest in general practice and lessen the effects of the inverse care law, under which those most in need of healthcare have least access to it"".
He added: ""The root cause of the inverse care law has to be addressed in order to effectively tackle the health inequalities resulting from it.
""Investment in the Scottish government's leading Govan SHIP (Social and Health Integrated Partnership) project has shown that there can be positive outcomes as a result of investing in these areas.
""Of course, this investment should not be at the cost of remote and rural areas, where the expense of providing care is inevitably high and needs to be seen through the much wider scope of GP work operating without the back-up of the wider primary care team.
""Instead, such new, targeted investment should be seen as part of a package of support that recognises the vital work general practice performs across Scotland to support those most in need and to realise the stated priorities of the present Scottish government.""
Green MSP Alison Johnstone has also written to Ms Robison calling for spending on GP practices to be better targeted in the most deprived areas.
She said: ""I am very concerned about recent figures showing that GP practices in the most-deprived 10% of postcodes receive just £3.79 more per patient than those in the least-deprived.
""This cannot adequately allow GPs to address unmet need and respond to complex health problems.
""What is even more concerning is that practices in the most-deprived 20% of postcodes actually receive £1.34 less per patient than those in the least-deprived 20%.
""Greens believe the way that funding is distributed directly to GPs should change so that GPs in more deprived areas receive a greater share of funding.""
Ms Robison said: ""We are determined to tackle health inequalities through primary care services. By the end of this parliament, we will have invested an extra £500m in primary and GP care.""
The number of community links workers will be increased to 250 in disadvantaged areas over the next five years, she said.
""Adjusting the Scottish allocation formula might also help to tackle health inequalities,"" she added.

747,"US President Barack Obama welcomed the pope as he landed on Tuesday - a rare honour for a foreign dignitary.
The pontiff will visit Washington DC, New York and Philadelphia.
Before he departed Cuba on Tuesday, he called on its people to live a ""revolution of tenderness"".
In the final Mass of his four-day visit to the island, with President Raul Castro attending, he urged thousands of Cubans to serve one another and not an ideology.
On the trip from Cuba to the US, the Pope held a news conference and answered those who said his criticisms of capitalism went too far.
""I've never said anything that is not in the social doctrine of the church,"" the Pope told reporters. ""Maybe I have given the impression of (being) a bit lefty, but that would be a mistaken interpretation.""
When he landed at Andrews Air Force Base, the Pope was greeted by Mr Obama and his family along with Vice-President Joe Biden and his wife.
The crowd, which included a military honour guard, schoolchildren, politicians, and Roman Catholic clergymen, chanted: ""Welcome to the USA! Hello! Hey!""
After a brief chat with Mr Obama, the pope rode away in a small charcoal-gray Fiat as part of a motorcade bound for the Vatican diplomatic mission in Washington.
Taking questions from journalists, the Pope answered in Spanish and Italian for almost half an hour - apologizing that English was not his forte.
Asked why he hadn't met dissidents in Cuba, he said he had had no private audiences with anyone. However, he had greeted all those invited to meet him on the steps of Havana Cathedral - who may have included dissidents. Now, Pope Francis is starting to focus on the US leg of his visit - which could be just as tricky a diplomatic balancing act.
Pope Francis was asked about his criticisms of capitalism. Earlier this year, he termed unbridled capitalism ""the dung of the devil"".
He responded that he wasn't really a leftie and that in his many statements on the economy, he had never gone against the Church's social doctrine.
Then, he jokingly offered to recite the Creed, in order to prove that he, the Pope, was indeed Catholic.
Authorities have launched one of the biggest security operations in US history to ensure the pope's safety.
The pontiff, who has sought to bring Catholics back to the church with a more inclusive message, is very popular in the US and is expected to draw massive crowds in all three cities.
A large portion of central Philadelphia will be practically closed off during his visit and federal employees in Washington have been urged to work remotely while the Pope is in the capital.
The event could attract up to a million and a half people.
The Pope enjoys going into crowds and using an open-sided Jeep rather than a bulletproof ""popemobile"", throwing US law enforcement off as they mount huge security operations.
The BBC's Will Grant in Cuba says the Pope has avoided any overt political statements during his visit there but commentators say he is expected to be more outspoken while in the US.

Phil Thompson, former Liverpool captain, tweeted: ""Well done to all the families, they've all fought with integrity and dignity throughout, justice has now been done""
Former Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez also added a message of support in a statement, saying: ""After so many years fighting for justice I am really pleased to see the verdict today, which confirms what we have been saying for a long time.
""I am especially pleased for the families of the 96 who have sought justice for so long and with such dignity, as well as for the people of Liverpool and for football fans in general.
""Hopefully this verdict today will ensure that this kind of tragedy can never happen again.""
Kenny Dalglish MBE, former Liverpool footballer and manager, said: ""Everything they've fought for for the past 27 years, they've won. Every argument that was put in front of them. They've been totally vindicated, the fans, and the families have also been totally victorious in everything they put forward.
""The truth that they knew 27 years ago has just come to pass now, and it's taken them 27 years of their lives to fight for the person who went to watch a football match and lost a life. You cannot surmise, or even begin to guess, what those families have been through.""
Liverpool chairman Tom Werner also released a statement, adding: ""We have been moved and inspired by the great courage shown by the families and survivors. We feel deep sorrow for their loss, take inspiration from their campaign and express gratitude for bringing honour to the club through their conduct during this cruelly prolonged process.""
Former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard, whose cousin, 10-year-old Jon-Paul Gilhooley, was the youngest victim of the tragedy, posted a tribute on Instagram, showing the Hillsborough memorial at Anfield alongside the words: ""JFT 96 #YNWA"".
Sheffield Wednesday FC: ""First and foremost, we recognise the tireless dedication of the families who have remained dignified throughout this process despite the enormously difficult evidence that had to be heard in detail over the course of the inquests.
""Since the disaster, football has evolved immeasurably, with all stadia and associated safety procedures changing beyond recognition in the intervening years.
""Both the ownership and leadership of Sheffield Wednesday has also changed in this time and we reiterate that the sincere condolences of the current chairman, board of directors and everyone at the club remain with the families of the 96 and our thoughts are with all those affected by the tragic events of 1989.""
Everton FC: ""Everton Football Club salutes the Hillsborough families and their total vindication as Fighters for Justice. Theirs is the greatest victory in the history of football.
""RIP, the 96. Good night, God bless. From us across the Park.""
Former Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie, who oversaw the newspaper when it published a story blaming Liverpool fans for the Hillsborough disaster, has said his ""heart goes out"" to the families and friends who have waited for vindication.
The Sun ran a front page story four days after the tragedy proclaiming to tell ""The Truth"" about the human crush which left 96 people dead.
It featured claims from an anonymous policeman that some fans had ""picked pockets of victims"", ""urinated on cops"" and that some beat up a policeman giving the ""kiss of life"".
Mr MacKenzie has now apologised for the ""hurt"" the story caused.
In a statement he said: ""Today's verdicts are an important step in obtaining justice for the victims. My heart goes out to those who have waited so long for vindication.
""As I have said before, the headline I published was wrong and I am profoundly sorry for the hurt it caused.""
He said his paper's coverage was based on what is now known from the inquest to be ""deliberate misinformation from the South Yorkshire Police"".
""Clearly, I was wrong to take the police's version of events at face value and it is a mistake I deeply regret.""
Mr MacKenzie added: ""The Crown Prosecution Service must now ensure that those officers within South Yorkshire Police responsible for the cover-up are brought to trial.""
The current head of Yorkshire Ambulance Service said he is ""truly sorry"" for what happened at Hillsborough and admits lives could have been saved if the ambulance service's response had been different.
Rod Barnes said the service fully accepted the jury's conclusions and extended his ""deepest sympathy"" to the bereaved families.
He said ""a huge amount has been learned from Hillsborough"" and the service has ""changed a great deal in the last 27 years"".
St John Ambulance chief executive Sue Killen said her organisation's volunteers ""acted as best they could under extremely difficult circumstances"" and their experience ""will stay with our organisation forever"".
""Our thoughts are with everyone who has been affected by what happened on that day... It's clear from the testimonies that our volunteers acted as best they could under extremely difficult circumstances, and we are grateful to them for all they did,"" she said.
David Whitmore, an expert in pre-hospital care, had told the inquests that while the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service response was delayed, volunteers from St John Ambulance ""behaved better"" than their counterparts by starting to help victims immediately.
Mr Richardson said: ""We would like to say sorry on behalf of the company at that time and to add our deepest sympathies to all those affected by this tragedy.
""We would also like to add that we are a very different company today and there is no-one here who has any first-hand knowledge of the stadium design decisions concerning Hillsborough in the 1980s.
""This was a terrible, tragic incident that will never be forgotten and out of the disaster there has come a legacy of improved stadium safety throughout the country.""
""Our sincere condolences remain with the families and friends of the victims. They have conducted themselves with great dignity throughout these Inquests, during which there has been an exhaustive investigation of the horrific circumstances that took place 27 years ago.
""Ultimately, the Inquests stand as testament to the struggle undertaken by the families so the truth might be brought to light.
""While much has changed since 1989, the FA and English football in general must continue to recognise, remember and learn from the tragedy. In looking forward, it is important we never forget.
""Given the ongoing criminal investigations, there are limitations to what we can say. It is in the interests of all concerned that further consideration of the disaster by the relevant authorities must be allowed to take its course.""
Ms Hemming said: ""Following the inquest's determinations the CPS team will continue to work closely with Operation Resolve and the IPCC as in due course, the CPS will formally consider whether any criminal charges should be brought against any individual or corporate body based upon all the available evidence, in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors.
""We would ask that everyone is mindful of the continuing investigations and the potential for future criminal proceedings when reporting or publicly commenting on the inquest's conclusions.""
Ms Cerfontyne said: ""The conclusion of the inquests is another milestone and a day when my thoughts are with the families and friends of those who died as a result of the disaster.
""Now the inquests have ended our role in providing documents and other material to support the Coroner is over. However the end of the inquests does not mark the end of the process.
""Our attention now focuses on concluding our criminal investigation into the aftermath of the disaster. This is by far the biggest and most complex investigation ever undertaken by the IPCC.
""We have made significant progress on the investigation and we will continue to work closely with Operation Resolve and the Crown Prosecution Service to pursue our remaining lines of enquiry as quickly and as thoroughly as possible. I anticipate we will conclude the criminal investigations by the turn of the year.""
Malcolm McMahon said: ""I hope that the acknowledgment that those who died were unlawfully killed will bring comfort to the survivors and the families of the 96.
""May they rest in peace, to be for ever remembered in the hearts and minds of the people of Liverpool.""","The families of the 96 Liverpool fans who died in the Hillsborough disaster have welcomed the verdict of unlawful killing by the jury in the inquests into the tragedy. The families have been campaigning for justice for 27 years and have finally seen their tireless efforts come to fruition. The jury also found that the police were responsible for the disaster and that the ambulance service failed to respond adequately to the emergency. The families have expressed their gratitude to the public for their support and have called for the immediate resignation of David Crompton, the chief constable of South Yorkshire Police. The Prime Minister has also paid tribute to the families and has called the verdict a landmark day that provides long overdue justice.</s>",mistral7b,XSUM,

Nadal has been troubled by injuries in recent years, but reached his first Grand Slam semi-final since 2014 with a superb quarter-final victory over Canadian third seed Milos Raonic.
If Nadal beats 25-year-old Dimitrov then all four singles finalists will be aged over 30, as 35-year-old Serena Williams meets older sister Venus, 36, in the women's final.
Dimitrov, who has never reached a Grand Slam final, is aiming to prevent Federer, Nadal and the Williams sisters contesting the two finals at a major for the first time since 2008 Wimbledon.
The Bulgarian 15th seed is playing some of the best tennis of his career having won the Brisbane International earlier this month and then carrying on his form in Melbourne.
He beat 11th seed David Goffin of Belgium in straight sets in the quarter-finals to record his 10th successive victory.
""I feel like I have all the tools to go further and my job isn't over yet,"" he said. ""I'm looking forward to my match. I think I'm prepared.
""I'm ready to go the distance. I don't shy away from that. I'm confident enough to say that as I feel good physically, and overall on the court.""

""I'm happy we had some epic battles over the years and of course it would be unreal to play here. I think both of us would never have thought we would be here playing in the final.""
Federer has a perfect record against Dimitrov, winning all five of their previous meetings.

The complex is owned by Taiwanese group Formosa Plastics and the workers had been subcontracted by a branch of South Korea's Samsung group, reports said.
One injured man said the scaffolding had started shaking an hour after they began work, and that many people had panicked and tried to escape.

The driver of the lorry was identified as  Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, a 31-year-old Tunisian man.
Paris prosecutor Francois Molins says Lahouaiej-Bouhlel was divorced with three children. His ex-wife was taken into custody along with four other people believed to be linked to him. A flat he lived in near Nice railway station was searched by police.
Lahouaiej-Bouhlel was ""totally unknown"" to security services, and investigations are continuing into whether he acted alone, Mr Molins said.
Lahouaiej-Bouhlel is said to have hired the lorry from a rental company in Saint-Laurent-du-Var, a town to the west of Nice, on 11 July. He had been due to return it on 13 July.
Police said that, at the time of the attack, Lahouaiej-Bouhlel was in possession of an automatic pistol, bullets, a fake automatic pistol and two replica assault rifles (a Kalashnikov and an M16), an empty grenade. Also in the lorry with him were a driving licence and a bank card.
Who was the Nice attacker?
Eighty-six people were killed, all but three of them at the time of the attack. The dead included 10 children and teenagers.
A total of 303 people were taken to hospital for medical treatment. A man who was badly injured in the assault died on 4 August, taking the total number of those killed to 85.
In the hours after the attacks, worried relatives posted images on social media of the missing.
Among the dead was Fatima Charrihi, whose son said she was the first to die.
Another victim, according to reports, was the assistant head of the Nice border police, Jean-Marc Leclerc.
An American 11-year-old boy, Brodie Copeland, and his father, Sean, were also killed. They had been on holiday in Nice.
Three people on a school trip from Germany were unaccounted for.

French security officials are still assessing whether the driver of a truck was working alone or in a group.
So-called Islamic State later claimed one of its followers carried out the attack.
A news agency linked to the group, Amaq Agency, said: ""He did the attack in response to calls to target the citizens of the coalition that is fighting the Islamic State.""
Officials said it bore the hallmark of a terrorist organisation.
President Hollande said it was ""an attack whose terrorist nature cannot be denied"".
Mr Molins said the attack was ""in line with the constant calls to kill"" from militant Islamist groups, and the investigation would be seek to find out whether Lahouaiej-Bouhlel had ties to Islamist militants.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said Lahouaiej-Bouhlel seemed to have been ""radicalised very quickly"".
Anti-terrorist prosecutors in Paris have launched an inquiry for murder and attempted murder as part of an organised terrorist strike.
France's DGSI internal security organisation warned of the danger of further attacks from Islamist militants with ""booby-trapped vehicles and bombs"".
The so-called Islamic State has targeted France on several occasions since January 2015.
Only hours before the Nice attack, President Hollande had announced that France's state of emergency would be removed later this month. After the attack in Nice he announced it was being extended.
The terror began a little after 22:30 (20:30 GMT) on 14 July, shortly after thousands of people had watched a firework display on the seafront.
There had been a mood of celebration and the crowd had enjoyed an air force display. Families strolled along the city's renowned Promenade des Anglais.
A large white lorry was seen driving erratically a couple of streets away from the seafront promenade. ""He was speeding up, braking, speeding up again and braking again. We thought it was weird,"" said Laicia Baroi. She described how the lorry then turned on to the promenade heading south-west towards the airport.
But it was not for another half hour before the attack began. A German journalist saw events unfold from a hotel balcony, as the lorry doubled back from the direction of the airport, breaching the barriers erected on the promenade opposite the Lenval children's hospital.
""He was driving really slowly, that's what was astonishing,"" said Richard Gutjahr, who described seeing the lorry being tailed by a motorcyclist. ""The motorcyclist tried to overtake him and even tried opening the lorry driver's door,"" he told AFP news agency. At that point the motorcyclist fell under the wheels of the lorry.
When two police officers opened fire on the lorry, the driver accelerated and careered at full speed towards the crowd.
The vehicle mounted the kerb then went back on the road, zigzagging for up to 2km (1.25 miles), as the driver deliberately drove into people.
A local MP spoke of hundreds of people being run over. Others scrambled to safety, on to the beach or into nearby hotels.
""I was opposite the Palais de la Mediterranee [hotel] when I saw a lorry at high speed running over people. I saw it with my own eyes, people tried to stop it,"" said one witness.
Police finally managed to bring the lorry to a halt near the luxury hotel.
Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins says the driver fired repeatedly on three policemen, who returned fire and pursued him for hundreds of metres.
Mobile phone footage appeared to show the moment the driver was shot.
Images from the scene showed the windscreen and front of the lorry raked with bullets. Interior ministry officials later confirmed that the attacker had been ""neutralised"".
It soon became clear that many people had died, although the full scale of the disaster was unclear. The dead and injured were taken to the local Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nice.
In the area around Nice, the anti-terror alert was raised to its highest level.
President Francois Hollande was flown back to Paris from a visit to Avignon, joining Prime Minister Manuel Valls in a crisis room. Mr Valls declared three days of mourning.
The pair then travelled to Nice, where the interior and health ministers were already involved in crisis meetings with local officials.
Mr Hollande met his defence and security chiefs and cabinet ministers.
Later, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve called on ""patriotic citizens"" to become reservists to boost security across the country.

Dr Gabriel Heaton of auction house Sotheby's said the painting had been ""crucial in transforming her from a novelist into a national figure"".
Sotheby's said it was bought by an anonymous private collector.
The Jane Austen House Museum in Chawton, Hampshire, said it did not bid because it could not raise the funds so soon after buying a ring that belonged to the author for £149,000 in September.
The painting had a pre-sale estimate of £150,000-£200,000.
The Reverend James Edward Austen-Leigh, Austen's nephew, asked artist James Andrews to create the painting for a biography.
It was based on the only confirmed portrait of Austen made before her death in 1817 - a sketch by her sister Cassandra, which is in the National Portrait Gallery.
He felt the sketch of his aunt did not do her justice, and used Andrews' painting for his book Memoir of Jane Austen.
Dr Heaton called the painting the ""most important likeness of Jane Austen ever likely to appear on the open market"".
""Seeing the most famous image of Jane Austen, for the first time, in a domestic sitting room was an astonishing experience,"" he said.
""This delicate watercolour is so much more than a piece of literary portraiture - it is part of our cultural history.""
He said the portrait gave readers ""an image with which they could identify and which even seemed to embody the character of her work"".

He added: ""It is the first time I leave and they are happy. Before they were walking the streets with their heads low.

Wenger's only previous win over Mourinho came in the 2015 Community Shield, when the Portuguese was in his second spell at Chelsea.
The managers first met in December 2004 - when the Gunners were still playing at their former ground Highbury - in a 2-2 draw.

United conclude their Europa League semi-final against Celta Viga at Old Trafford on Thursday, having beaten the Spanish side 1-0 in the first leg on Thursday.
""We want to try to win the Europa League - it's more important than finishing fourth. I think it will be almost impossible to qualify through the Premier League,"" Mourinho said.
""Trophies make history. Not league positions. We go with everything to get into that final.
""Thursday is the match of the season. I hope Old Trafford feels the same, because we need Old Trafford.""

""The idea that fake news on Facebook influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea,"" he said.
""If you believe that then I don't think you have internalised the message Trump supporters are trying to send in this election.""
Some data has shown that fake stories were being far more widely shared on the platform than follow up stories debunking the claims.
Can social media predict election results?
For an increasing number of people, particularly Americans, Facebook is becoming the primary source of news coverage.
The site's News Feed is specifically designed to show users content it thinks will be of most interest, creating what some describe as a ""filter bubble"" that reinforces a person's view without injecting differences in opinion.
Earlier this year, Facebook was accused of being anti-Trump after it was alleged its human moderators were favouring liberal stories appearing in people's ""trending stories"" box.
While denying that claim, the site did sack its human team, instead relying solely on an algorithm to determine which stories were shown to be most popular.
As a consequence, stories which were later proved entirely false appeared on the timelines of a large number of users.
When asked about checks and balances needed to keep a company like Facebook in line, Mr Zuckerberg said it was about ""listening to what people want"".
""My goal, and what I care about, is giving people the power to share so we can make the world more open and connected. That requires building a good version of News Feed. We still have work to do on that. Weâ€™re going to keep improving it.
""On the community guidelines, I think as norms change and people want to see more news, I think we'll have to continue to evolve the guidelines to reflect the value that the community holds.""

767,"That they will now be beaten in both the Test and the series is a result of a first-innings collapse and some really poor bowling.
""Plunkett's dismissal summed it up. We thought the nightmare of Australia was over but it is still here. I don't know where this side go.
""Cook is in terrible form. He will get tenser, it will get harder and I don't know how he is going to get out of it. It's a recipe for resignation. I don't know if he will but it is.""
In both matches, England have been in winning positions but, bruised from their 5-0 Ashes humiliation, this developing side simply have not had the confidence to nail them down.
In the first Test at Lord's, a first-innings lead was undermined by a collapse on the fourth afternoon that ultimately left England short of time to bowl Sri Lanka out on the final day.
And here at Headingley, they slumped from 278-2 to 365 all out in the first innings, let Sri Lanka post 457 in their second, then crumbled to 57-5 in their chase of 350.
To take the bowling first, I never thought I would find myself saying that Sri Lanka's pace bowlers had shown England's quicks how to bowl at Headingley, the home of English seam bowling.
Put simply, England's pacers have been outperformed by a nation of spin bowlers. There was some talk about this Sri Lanka attack being no better than a county side. Maybe a county attack would have bowled better than England on that pitch today.
There was seam, swing and the odd hint of uneven bounce to be had on the fourth day. But, Liam Plunkett aside, a pace quartet that also contains James Anderson, Stuart Broad and Chris Jordan has been way below par.
Plunkett has run in hard and bowled with hostility, but Anderson has bowled too short, Broad has taken a hat-trick but nothing else and Jordan will end the Test wicketless.
Some may criticise England's tactics today, and they certainly contributed to their problems. By dropping men back in the hope that Angelo Mathews would surrender the strike to Rangana Herath during the early part of the Sri Lanka pair's eight-wicket stand of 149, England had nowhere else to go when the plan did not work.
Captain Alastair Cook might also have opted to use the spin of Moeen Ali earlier, but he could have justifiably expected his pace bowlers to do the job and they failed him.
None of this should take anything away from the efforts of Mathews, who made a wonderful 160.
1st Test v Sri Lanka, Lord's: Match drawn
20 June: 2nd Test v Sri Lanka, Headingley
9 July: 1st Test v India, Trent Bridge

Not only did he negotiate the strike, but the Sri Lanka captain also hit boundaries with cavalier regularity. It was a serious innings delivered in a calm, patient, assured manner.
In Herath, he found a tail-end ally who made an immense contribution. Herath is clearly no mug, demonstrated by the fact he settled in for nearly three hours. It was quite brilliant.
Their efforts were in contrast to England's performance with the bat, which cracked under the pressure applied by Dhammika Prasad, bowling the sort of line and length of which England were incapable.
Cook's dismissal typifies where his game is at the moment. The image of him staring back at his broken stumps after bottom-edging a pull at such a wide ball encapsulated his predicament.
Gary Ballance was unfortunate - anyone can get a first baller - while Ian Bell got a beauty. In between, Sam Robson played a poor shot to edge to second slip.
But it was all summed up by Plunkett, the nightwatchman, scooping Herath's spin to cover when he should have been blocking out the final over.
It was a hideous end to a hideous day.","England has lost the second Test to Sri Lanka due to poor bowling and a first-innings collapse.

Det Ch Supt Russ Jackson, from the North West Counter Terrorism Unit, said: ""I want to stress that this is a different item than the one he used in the attack.
""We have no reason to believe the case and its contents contain anything dangerous, but would ask people to be cautious.""
He added: ""The public should not approach the case if they see it but contact police immediately on 999.""

Officers have been searching a landfill site in Pilsworth near Bury.
Footage of the search shows investigators in white boiler suits and blue helmets raking through the debris near a large red tent.
Earlier, there were searches in Whalley Range, Manchester and in Chester and Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex, where a 23-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences.

Manchester Victoria station will also reopen on Tuesday, British Transport Police have said.
The station, which is connected to Manchester Arena where the bomb went off, suffered structural damage in the incident.
NHS England said 52 people injured in the attack were still being treated in hospital - including 19 in critical care.
Abedi detonated a bomb on 22 May at the end of a concert by US singer Ariana Grande.
MI5 said it would hold an inquiry into the way it dealt with warnings from the public that he was a potential threat.
The security service, which was alerted to his extremist views three times prior to last Monday's attack, will examine how it dealt with the warnings.
Home Secretary Amber Rudd said it was right for MI5 to review its processes.
MI5 has launched a ""post incident investigation"" into how the Manchester bomber was overlooked, while a separate report is being prepared for ministers and those who oversee the work of the service.
A Whitehall official said previously that Abedi was one of a ""pool"" of former subjects of interest whose risk remained ""subject to review"" by the security service and its partners.
Born in Manchester to Libyan parents, BBC Newsnight reported that when Abedi was 16 he fought against the Colonel Gaddafi regime with his father during the school holidays.
It was while at Manchester College that two people who knew Abedi have confirmed they made separate calls to an anti-terrorism hotline to warn the police about his extremist views.

773,"He also said the Justice Department acted unlawfully by failing to provide sufficient resources to examine alleged flaws in a murder investigation.
It followed a legal challenge by the family of murder victim Patrick Murphy.
They were told the Police Ombudsman's inquiry was not expected to be completed until 2025.
Mr Murphy was shot dead on his 63rd birthday as he served customers at his grocer's shop on Belfast's Mount Merrion Avenue in November 1982.
No-one has ever been convicted for the sectarian killing, believed to have been carried out by the UVF.
The victim's family lodged a complaint with the Police Ombudsman about how the murder investigation was handled in 2004, and again in 2009.
They raised concerns about alleged failings and missed opportunities in the course of the investigation.
But, in 2014, they were told that staffing levels within the unit of the Ombudsman's office dealing with their case had been reduced by 25%.
With budgetary cuts also imposed, the family was informed that the relevant programme of investigations could not be completed before 2025.
Mr Murphy's daughter, Patricia Bell, launched judicial review proceedings against the Ombudsman and the Department of Justice over the investigative delays.
Counsel for the Ombudsman's Office conceded it was in breach of its statutory duty to investigate within a reasonable time.
Ms Bell's lawyers described the Ombudsman, Dr Michael Maguire, and his team as ""blameless"".
Instead, they argued that the Justice Department was frustrating an obligation imposed on it by Parliament to allocate sufficient funding.
Delivering judgment, High Court judge Mr Justice Maguire backed the family's case.
""The court has no difficulty in concluding that, on the balance of probability, the source of the problem besetting the Police Ombudsman's office lies with the failure of government, most directly the Department of Justice, to provide adequate resources to the Police Ombudsman,"" he said.
It would be unlikely for Parliament to have intended the funding authority to have put the watchdog in a position of acting unlawfully, the judge pointed out.
Ruling that the situation was unreasonable, he said: ""The present case is one of systemic and persistent underfunding which is disabling the Police Ombudsman, not in one but in a range of cases, and not in one lone period but over a period now of years, from being able to meet a not particularly demanding standard, that of carrying out its investigation into a public complaint against the police within a reasonable time.""",The Justice Department was found to have acted unlawfully by failing to provide sufficient resources to examine alleged flaws in a murder investigation.

Virgil van Dijk volleyed in Dusan Tadic's cross to put Southampton in front, but Steven Whittaker levelled with a penalty after Harry Lewis fouled Cameron Jerome.
Maya Yoshida's header looked to have won it for the Premier League side.
But Naismith glanced in Whittaker's cross for a dramatic equaliser.
Southampton will host the Canaries in the replay in the week beginning 16 January.
Saints boss Claude Puel made eight changes from their 3-0 loss against Everton, possibly with Wednesday's League Cup semi-final first leg against Liverpool in mind.
And it looked like the decision to drop defender Jose Fonte, who handed in a transfer request this week, in favour of the returning Van Dijk would pay dividends.
The Dutchman, who had served a one-match suspension, applied a composed finish to give Saints the lead and illustrated why he is in such high demand.
But with three consecutive defeats in the Premier League, Puel will be starting to come under pressure, particularly after failing to beat a second-tier side.
Debutant keeper Lewis had a rough afternoon, mis-controlling a ball and then fouling Jerome for the Norwich penalty, and a Saints defence that has now conceded 11 goals in four games failed to hold out in injury time.
Norwich have tumbled from Championship title contenders to play-off hopefuls since the start of the season, although boss Alex Neil slightly quietened calls for his departure with a 3-0 win over Derby on Monday.
And while promotion back to the Premier League will be prioritised over an FA Cup run, Naismith's late leveller will go a long way to helping Neil win back the favour of an increasingly disgruntled Canaries fan base.
Carrow Road is regularly sold out for league matches, but the stadium was half-full, with sections of supporters unhappy at the £25 ticket price.
The fact that Norwich had failed to win 14 of their last 18 third-round FA Cup matches may have contributed towards the antipathy.
But the home side's determination, shown by Jerome's closing down of the keeper to win the penalty and the spirit to equalise at the end, suggest the Canaries may be able to rekindle their form in the league.
Norwich boss Alex Neil: ""At times we could have played better but the pleasing thing is to get the response. We worked to the end.
""Steven Naismith worked his socks off and really deserved his goal. I'm delighted for him.
""A draw was probably a fair result. We wanted to carry on the momentum from Derby and with the late equaliser this was a positive result.""
Southampton boss Claude Puel: ""It's difficult to accept this because I think it's always difficult to play away against a Championship team.
""I think we have had control of the game and have scored two fantastic goals through Virgil and Maya.
""It's a pity and we find it difficult to take this goal in the last minute. I think it's our fault and that these possibilities happen.
""It's without a week of recovery and work, but it's our fault and it's important to have a good answer in the next game against Norwich.""

777,"The vast north-eastern Sambisa forest is where they have many bases - and it has been subject to aerial bombardments since February.
There has been speculation that some of the Chibok schoolgirls kidnapped more than a year ago are being held there.
Boko Haram has killed thousands in northern Nigeria since 2009.
Nigeria's military, backed by troops from neighbouring countries, launched an offensive against Boko Haram in February - and has recaptured most of the territory the militants had taken in the previous year.
For the latest news, views and analysis see the BBC Africa Live page.
Some of the abducted schoolgirls, who escaped shortly after they were seized, have told the BBC they had been kept in militant camps in the Sambisa forest.
BBC Africa security correspondent Tomi Oladipo says the Nigerian military has been steadily reclaiming territory from the insurgents and sees the takeover of Sambisa as one of its biggest goals.
But our correspondent says the Sambisa forest, which incorporates a former game reserve, is far larger than any other territory that has been fought over so far.
The aerial bombardments on Sambisa, which is mainly in north-eastern Borno state, have been slowed down by weather conditions and poor visibility, he says.
Military spokesman Major-General Chris Olukolade refused to give any further details about the offensive.

Who are the militants?
Outgoing President Goodluck Jonathan has been widely criticised for not doing enough to end the conflict.
But his government has now vowed to crush the group before he hands over to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari at the end of May.
An estimated three million people have been forced from their homes since 2009, when Boko Haram launched its insurgency to create an Islamic state.
Hundreds have also been kidnapped by the group, including more than 200 girls taken from their boarding school in the Borno town of Chibok last April.

780,"The month-long undercover investigation found people were made to sign up as self-employed when legally they should have been classified as employees.
Soap and Co. says it was ""extremely concerned"" about the allegations.
It said it planned to review the employment status of workers.
The company describes its products as ""an ideal balance between beauty, health and simple indulgence"".
During the BBC London-Newsnight investigation, an undercover reporter spent one month working for the company, documenting the treatment of staff and their employment conditions.
They were made to be at work for a minimum of six days per week, for a total of about 60 hours, at the firm's stores.
Workers are paid by commission based on their sales. Some earned better under the arrangement than others.
The BBC's undercover reporter was paid £199 in commission for 97 hours' work - equivalent to an hourly rate of £2.05.
The national minimum wage ranges from £4.05 for under-18s to £7.50 for someone aged over 25.
The BBC also asked the two managers that the undercover reporter worked for about their understanding of the working relationship. They did not respond.
The BBC was told the same arrangements were in place at the company's affiliated Sakare outlets in Mayfair and Covent Garden.
One employee said: ""I cannot move, I'm tired, my body hurts.""
Another said: ""My lower back hurts. I'm smashed physically and mentally. This is not normal.""
Fines were handed out if workers were caught checking their mobile phones.
Soap and Co. mainly recruits workers from Eastern Europe, and some staff paid for cramped accommodation with shared bedrooms.
Employment lawyer Arpita Dutt described what had happened as a ""flagrant breach"" of minimum wage legislation.
She said: ""This does seem to be exploitation of workers.
""It reminds me of those days where we used to have master-servant relationships.""
Staff had prescriptive hours, they were not allowed to work elsewhere, or to substitute another ""self-employed"" individual to cover a shift.
The investigation found workers had to sign contracts saying they were self-employed.
But lawyers have told the BBC that the high level of control exercised by managers over workers meant in reality they were employees.
This means they should have been paid the minimum wage and a host of other in-work benefits - including sick pay and holiday pay.
""What we're finding is a real case of abuse... a whole raft of employment legislation that has been with us for 30 years is being cast aside in one blink of an eye,"" said Meredith Hurst, a partner at employment lawyers Thomas Mansfield. ""I find it quite shocking.
""This is a very extreme case of control over an individual, and there is no doubt in my mind these individuals are employees.
""I would say that what we're seeing is a sham situation.""
Workers being ""self-employed"" also saves a company paying national insurance.
Neither HM Revenue & Customs nor the Office of National Statistics publishes official figures for bogus self-employment.
But the overall PAYE tax gap - the difference between the amount of tax that should theoretically be collected from people's pay packets and what is actually taken - is currently £2.8bn.
In a statement, Soap and Co. said: ""Soap and Co. takes their responsibility under UK law very seriously. We are therefore extremely concerned to learn about the allegations made by some individuals about the company's working arrangements.
""As a consequence we are reviewing those allegations and the implications (if any) regarding the employment status of those who work with us.""

782,"US-supported fighters have been airlifted by the American military in a bid to retake Tabqa dam.
The development came as a US-led coalition met in Washington to discuss the battle against IS.
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said it was ""only a matter of time"" until IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed.
Wednesday's gathering at the State Department was the first summit of the full 68-member group since December 2014.
The Pentagon said US aircraft had dropped allied Syrian rebel infantry forces near Tabqa, 45km (28 miles) west of Raqqa, on the Euphrates River.
It said the aim was to seize the dam, which provides regional electricity. There is also a military airfield and a prison holding IS hostages there.
Spokesman Eric Pohan would not say how many US personnel were involved, but told the Associated Press that no American troops were engaged in front-line fighting.
He said the dam was ""significant as a strategic target'' whose capture would ""basically cut IS off'' from western approaches to Raqqa city.
The US allies, the Syrian Democratic Forces, said their fighters had seized four villages south of the Euphrates. The aim was both to capture Tabqa and to curb advances by Syrian government advances in the area.
The use of a US-provided airlift and fire support to facilitate an operation by its Syrian allies marks a small but significant stepping up of Washington's military role on the ground in Syria.
So far President Trump has sought to reinforce the previous administration's approach on Syria - putting in artillery and more troops on the ground and expanding what US forces can actually do.
US advisers, for example, are now much closer to the frontline and better able to help co-ordinate operations. It's still not clear what the full extent of US involvement in the Tabqa dam assault may be.
But news of the mission comes on the day that the Trump administration is setting out its approach to countering and destroying IS - the clear implication being that Mr Trump plans to do more.
Meanwhile, Mr Tillerson told the coalition that the US was ""ready to grow stronger and stay aggressive in this battle"" against so-called Islamic State.
It was the ""policy of the US to demolish and destroy this barbaric terrorist organisation"", he said.
Mr Tillerson told the summit that the coalition should be encouraged by the progress it was making.
He said the flow of foreign fighters into Syria and Iraq was down by 90% over the past year.
""It is harder for terrorists to get in and more importantly harder for them to get out to threaten our homelands,"" Mr Tillerson said.

He said that ""nearly all"" of the deputies of IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi were now dead.
""It is only a matter of time before Baghdadi himself meets this same fate,"" Mr Tillerson said.
Mr Tillerson admitted that ""a more defined course of action in Syria is still coming together"" but he spoke of working to ""establish interim zones of stability, through ceasefires, to allow refugees to return home"".
The BBC's Barbara Plett Usher, in Washington, says the secretary of state did not specify whether that would mean safe zones protected by coalition forces.
Mr Tillerson also told the summit: ""The United States will do its part, but the circumstances on the ground require more from all of you.
""I ask each country to examine how it can best support these vital stabilisation efforts.""
Separately, at least 33 people were killed in an air strike on a school in a village west of Raqqa on Monday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said.
It believed the raid was carried out US-led coalition jets. The coalition has made no immediate comment.

783,"The three firms will collaborate on the systems needed to make cars that can navigate without any help from a human driver.
The vehicles will be capable of driving safely along major roads as well as in suburban and inner city areas.
BMW said it hoped the collaboration would mean it could put robot cars into production by 2021.
The research partnership was announced on the day when US officials begin an investigation into a fatal car crash involving a Tesla Model S, to which self-driving technology could have contributed.
BMW said the trio would develop computer and sensor systems that gradually reduce the part humans play in driving a car. Ultimately, it said, it hoped to produce vehicles that could operate entirely autonomously without any people onboard.
Achieving this, said BMW, would make it possible for fleets of unmanned vehicles to operate safely. This, it added, could spur the creation of novel ride-sharing services in urban areas or lead to the creation of long-distance delivery services that employ robot-driven trucks.
In a statement, the three firms said they were ""convinced that automated driving technologies will make travel safer and easier"".
They pledged to make the results of the research available to other car makers and electronics firms to help standardise technologies used in autonomous vehicles.
Early work would focus on a ""highly automated driving"" prototype which BMW said it planned to demonstrate this year. More extensive tests of this technology across lots of vehicles were planned for 2017, it added.
The autonomous car that emerges from the partnership would be likely to be electric and called the iNext, it said. Other vehicles in the i-range include the i8 hybrid and the i3 all-electric vehicle.
Before now, BMW has shown off concept cars that use autonomous technology and it is already working with Baidu in China to produce a self-driving car suited to that market.","BMW, Intel and Mobileye have announced a collaboration to develop systems for self-driving cars.

784,"Louis Moult scored twice - a first-time lob and a close-range volley - to put the hosts in charge.
However, Callum McGregor's strike brought Celtic back into contention and Patrick Roberts headed them level.
Lionel Ainsworth quickly volleyed Well ahead again but that lead did not last long as Stuart Armstrong fired home before Rogic's low drive settled it.
Celtic ended the day still eight points clear at the top of the division and still have three games in hand.
This was a stunning game, a thrill-fest from start to finish with goals, chances, drama and aggravation all played out in a thunderous Fir Park.
The champions had not conceded in the league for 10 hours and were up against a Motherwell team that had conceded three in 90 minutes against Hearts last time out.
This looked like it was going to be another Celtic stroll, but Moult dynamited that notion after just three minutes.
It was a sumptuous finish, a thing of beauty. Stephen McManus aimed his downfield pass at the space occupied by Moult and his marker, Kolo Toure. The striker stole away from Toure and cushioned the dropping ball first time over Craig Gordon's head.
Toure's defending was poor and Gordon was caught too far off his line but Moult's precision was a delight.
Motherwell paid little regard for Celtic's reputation, hustling and harrying them, bringing a real edge to their game that Celtic found hard to deal with for a long time.
Moult was inches away from making it 2-0 just before the half-hour, but he got the job done just after.
Mikael Lustig was robbed of possession by Ross MacLean - the Swede was livid at the tackle - and when MacLean crossed to the back post, Moult took advantage of more slack Toure defending to bang in his second of the game and his 10th of the season.
Brendan Rodgers changed his formation at the break and went three at the back to give Celtic's midfield more ballast. It worked.
Within three minutes, McGregor, a first-half substitute for Emilio Izaguirre, played a one-two with the excellent Armstong and McGregor stroked his shot past Craig Samson.
Celtic now had Motherwell under the cosh and Armstrong's delivery from the left saw Roberts head the visitors level at the back post.
You'd have gambled your last penny on Celtic motoring on to win it at that point. Motherwell's energy levels were running out and they were seeing precious little of the ball. They looked like they were barely hanging on.
Just when you thought that Motherwell's day was going to peter out into defeat, they roused themselves again and got themselves back in front.
Roberts had scored in the 69th minute, then from a Steven Hammell cross, Ainsworth scored in the 70th. Celtic's defence was left with giant gaps and the substitute pocked home from close range.
Sixty seconds later, we had the third goal in as many minutes when Armstrong's shot on the turn beat Samson. Fast, furious, frenetic and utterly absorbing.
A minute from time, Rogic moved forward, picked his spot and smashed a shot past Samson to win this most gob-smacking game.
Celtic's character and quality in adversity was huge. Motherwell gave so much and did so many superb things, but, sickeningly for Mark McGhee and his team, they were denied the consolation of a point.
Motherwell manager Mark McGhee: ""We know we're a team that concede goals. We have to fix that, somehow we have to fix that.
""Our first-half performance was fantastic, the quality of our three goals was fantastic.
""We've played a really good Celtic team, they've fought back into it and eventually they've got a winning goal. We've just got to live with that but our performance was good.""
Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers: ""We were poor in the first half. We got off to an awful start.
""We changed the system at half-time to 3-4-3. We were absolutely brilliant second half. To score the four goals, to win the game, it really shows the mentality of the team.
""Across the team, I have to give them huge credit because we had to put risk in the game. They took on the risk and they got the reward. I'm delighted for them.
""That was a great, great victory for us and give credit to Motherwell as well because I thought that they were set up very, very well.""

""This would be a clear demonstration that what [Einstein] said 100 years ago is absolutely correct.""
On 25 November 1915, Albert Einstein presented the final version of his field equations to the Prussian Academy of Sciences.
They underpinned his Theory of General Relativity - a pillar of modern physics that has transformed our understanding of space, time and gravity.
From it, we have been able to understand so much - from the expansion of the Universe, to the motion of the planets and the existence of black holes.
But he also proposed the presence of gravitational waves, essentially ripples of energy that distort the fabric of space-time.
Think of them as a bit like the waves that radiate out when you throw a stone into a pond.
Any object with mass should generate them when it's on the move. Even us. But the greater the mass, and more dramatic the motion, the larger the waves.
And Einstein predicted that the Universe was awash with them.
Ripples in the fabric of space-time
But while astronomers have indirect evidence for their existence, getting a glimpse of these cosmic curiosities has not yet been possible.
Physicist Dr Toby Wiseman, from Imperial College London, UK, explained:  ""I'm not surprised we haven't directly seen gravity waves yet.
""Gravity is actually the most feeble of the forces and even dramatic astrophysical sources only emit weak gravity waves.""
Now, in Italy, scientists hope to find them. But it won't be easy.
The first incarnation of the Virgo experiment ran from 2007 - and didn't see anything. Neither did its US-counterpart, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Ligo).
But both machines - called interferometers - are now undergoing expensive upgrades, and the teams hope major improvements in sensitivity could hold the key to success.
Dr Frasconi explained: ""The technology available to detect gravitational waves is available just today.
""During the last 10 years, we have developed very sophisticated technology to construct this kind of interferometer.""
The scientists are attempting to spot the tiny distortions created when gravitational waves pass through the Earth.
They are hoping to see those emanating from violent cosmic events, such as exploding stars or colliding black holes.
iWonder: Does Einstein's general theory of relativity still matter?
The Virgo detector is formed of two identical 3km-tunnels, in a giant L-shape formation.
A laser beam is generated, then split into two - with one half being fired along one tunnel, and the other half surging through the second tunnel.
Mirrors at either end send the lasers travelling back and forth many times, before they are recombined.
This might seem elaborate, but it takes advantage of a handy property of lasers - the fact that they are intense beams of light, and light is a wave.
Imagine if two waves in the ocean crashed into each other, while one was at a peak, and one was at a trough - the waves would cancel each other out.
The same is true inside the experiment. And if the waves have travelled exactly the same distance along the two tunnels, then they cancel each other out, producing no signal.
However, if a gravitational wave has travelled through the tunnel, it will very subtly distort its surroundings, changing the length of the tunnels by a minute amount - just a fraction of the width of an atom.
And the way the waves move through space-time means that one tunnel would be stretched and one squeezed, which would result in one laser travelling a slightly longer distance while the other would have a shorter journey.
As a result, the split beams will re-combine in a different way: the waves of light will interfere with each other, rather than cancelling out -  and scientists will detect a signal.
Great efforts have been made to insulate the experiments from the general rumbles that pervade the Earth, from traffic noise to earthquakes.
""You are trying to a build a machine to avoid potential noise,"" says Dr Frasconi.
""This machine is anchored directly on the ground floor - and the ground floor typically vibrates.  The most important challenge is to isolate the mirrors.
""For Virgo, this is the most important challenge. From the beginning we have spent a lot of time to develop the multistage pendulum to isolate the mirrors from seismic noise.""
But even then, a signal in Italy will not be enough.
If a gravitational wave is spotted there, the upgraded Advanced Ligo in America, which has the same set-up as Virgo, but is made up of two detectors with 4km-long arms, should also see the signal. So potentially should another, smaller experiment in Germany.
Advanced Ligo is now up and running, and scientists hope Virgo will be ready to be switched on by the end of the year.
The collaborating teams are so confident of success that they're forecasting that 1 January 2017 will be the day the breakthrough is made.
This prediction may be a little tongue in cheek, but Dr Frasconi, who has been working in this field for two decades, is confident that the end of the search is near.
""Right now, it is extremely important to detect for the first time on Earth gravitational waves. Otherwise we do not have the right information, the right knowledge of the rest of the Universe.""
If the waves do not show up now it will mean that the experiments may need to be redesigned. And in the most extreme case, perhaps physicists might have to rethink the way that the Universe works.
But a direct glimpse will open a new window on the cosmos - one that wouldn't have been possible without Einstein.
Dr Wiseman, from Imperial College London, explains: ""Seeing gravity waves would be fantastic confirmation of our understanding of general relativity.
""We have good reason to think they exist, but we can't be sure we have understood general relativity correctly until we see these ripples in space-time directly.
""Observing them would allow us new ways to test general relativity, but also give us an entirely new tool for observing some of the most fascinating objects in our Universe.""

But he had previously abused three pupils at another school and escaped prosecution, Peterborough Crown Court heard.
Mr Ball denies indecency and sexual assault charges.
The court heard Mr Ball, 42, of Greenwich in London, was a teacher at a North Yorkshire school when the first alleged offences happened in the early 2000s.
He accepted a job at an independent school in Cambridgeshire while an investigation into the allegations was continuing, was given a positive reference from the North Yorkshire school and was not charged, Gregory Perrins, prosecuting, said.
Mr Ball was suspended from the Cambridgeshire school last year following allegations made by another pupil.
Mr Perrins told jurors: ""You're going to hear he has pleaded guilty to a number of charges arising out of those allegations.
""Police then had cause to revisit allegations made at his previous school and that's why there's been a significant delay between the offences we say were committed then and 2015.""
Mr Perrins said Mr Ball had sex with one of the girls in different locations and on multiple occasions, including in the school music room and on top of his wife's wedding dress at his house.
Mr Ball has since separated from his wife, who is expected to give evidence in the trial, Mr Perrins said.
He denies four counts of indecent assault and five counts of engaging in sexual activity while in a position of trust at the school in North Yorkshire.
The court heard that allegations were made at the time but the school's investigation was ""seriously lacking"".

789,"Best known as the karate kicking manservant in the Pink Panther films he was, following his first screen role in 1957, an ever present face on film and television.
Burt Kwouk was born in Manchester on 18 July 1930 because, as he later remarked, ""my mother happened to be there"".
In fact his parents were on a business trip and shortly after his birth, returned to Shanghai where Burt spent his early years before returning to the UK in 1954.
His first credited role was in McLeary Moves In, a thriller series based on the Morris West novel and broadcast by ABC television in 1957.
A year later he made his first major film appearance in The Inn of the Sixth Happiness, the true story of the English missionary to China Gladys Aylward.
Kwouk played Lee, the leader of a prison revolt who helps Aylward get a party of children to safely though Japanese lines.
He was one of the few genuinely Oriental actors to play a major role in the film with many of the other, ostensibly Chinese characters, being played by a European cast.
With British TV thrillers of the '60s and '70s seemingly unable to function without the obligatory oriental villain, Kwouk was rarely out of work.
In 1964 he made his first appearance as Cato, Inspector Clouseau's manservant, in the second of the Pink Panther films A Shot In The Dark.
In what became a running gag through the series Cato, a martial arts expert, was required to keep the Inspector on his guard by attacking him ""whenever and wherever I least expect it"".
In the same year he made the first of three appearances in the James Bond films with the part of Mr Ling, an associate of Goldfinger, in the film of the same name.
He appeared in two more Bond films in 1967 - the David Niven spoof Casino Royale and You Only Live Twice with Sean Connery.
He reprised his role of Cato in The Return of the Pink Panther in 1975, The Pink Panther Strikes Again in 1976 and in The Revenge Of The Pink Panther two years later.
He was also the narrator in the English version of the Japanese TV series The Water Margin, which ran in the UK in the late '70s and gained cult status.
There were two more appearances in Pink Panther films in the 1980s but, following the death of Peter Sellers, the series had run out of steam and was critically panned.
The BBC series Tenko, gave Kwouk his first major television drama role as Yamauchi, the commandant of a women's prisoner of war camp set up in Singapore following the Japanese invasion.
He handled the difficult role well, portraying a man who was not essentially evil, but who was a product of the military machine unable to show compassion to a defeated enemy.
A total of 30 one-hour episodes were produced between 1981 and 1984 with the majority of the series filmed in Dorset due to budgetary constraints.
In 1993 he made his last appearance as Cato in The Son Of The Pink Panther but as before, the absence of Peter Sellers proved too great and the film flopped.
He hosted E4's spoof Japanese TV gameshow Banzai in 2001, the highlight being Kwouk's ""Confucious say..."" style monologues.
It was ironic that, as one of the few British East Asian actors, he was caught up in the controversy surrounding the Channel 4 show The Missing Chink, in which he took a guest role.
Produced as an ironic comment on the relative unobtrusiveness of the Chinese community in Britain, it was attacked by some as  ""blatantly racist"" mainly on account of the provocative title.
He continued to play character roles in film and TV before joining the cast of the long-running BBC sitcom Last Of The Summer Wine in 2003.
His character, a Chinese washing machine repair man improbably named Entwistle, replaced the Compo character after the death of Bill Owen.
As one of the first British-Chinese actors there was never a shortage of parts and he seemed unconcerned about the dangers of being stereotyped.
He was yet another graduate of the school of great British character actors, with the ability to take a variety of roles ranging from slapstick comedy to strong drama.","Burt Kwouk was a British-Chinese actor born in Manchester in 1930.

Walsh believed the comments were tongue in cheek but fellow rider Lizzie Kelly said Tebbutt should be ""ashamed"".
Tebbutt said: ""I apologise if I have caused any offence, to anyone in Britain or across the world. That was never my intention.""
He added: ""My comments were misjudged.
""I spend a lot of my time coaching young jockeys - both male and female - and, while many of them have different strengths and weaknesses, I always treat them all as equals, exactly as they should be.""
Walsh was commissioned by BBC Sport to look at equality in racing for Women's Sport Week.
She asked Tebbutt, a coach at the British Racing School in Newmarket, what the main difference was between a male and female jockey.
Tebbutt replied: ""They go through the exact same training programme, with females knowing they have to put more in, so they will go the extra yard, knowing they have to catch the male up.""
Walsh responded: ""That's women for you.""
Tebbutt fires back: ""Still can't ride though.""
It intends to speak to Tebbutt about his conduct, insisting his views ""are not views that anyone involved in racing would endorse or share"".
It added: ""Racing is a unique sport, in that women and men compete on entirely equal terms as jockeys and trainers, and female riders have the full respect of their male counterparts in the weighing room.""
The winner of the Irish Grand National in April on Thunder And Roses, she genuinely believes Tebbutt's comments were been made in jest and felt he was ""trying to get me going"".
She added: ""I don't dispute the fact that male jockeys are stronger, but I was trying to say to him that it is not just strength which comes into play in a race. He didn't execute what he was trying to say very well.""
Jockey Martin Lane defended Tebbutt on Twitter, pointing out that he had successfully coached several female jockeys.
But Kelly, who won the Lanzarote Hurdle at Kempton on Tea For Two in January, said: ""Michael Tebbutt; be ashamed of yourself - a jockey coach whose opinion is 'girls still can't ride'. He actually said that.""

792,"Of course, the one moment I would really like to have over again is my conversion after Tim Swinson's try, which I managed to put under the bar from in front of the posts.
I rushed the kick and unfortunately as I ran up to strike the ball it fell off the tee. It cost us an easy two points, which was disappointing. It's a lesson learned - always make sure the ball is properly set up on the tee before taking the kick.
I'm not sure if that miss had any bearing on the final outcome. France elected to go for goal with a couple of penalties in the second half rather than kick for the corner and I did wonder during the game whether they might have made different decisions had I kicked that conversion to give us a five-point cushion. It could have changed the game but it's hard to tell.
It was a brutally physical game. There were a lot of sore bodies after it, a lot of injuries. The big negative for us - aside from the result obviously - was losing Greig Laidlaw and Josh Strauss for the rest of the tournament.
As captain, Greig has a massive impact on the team, on and off the field. He's a great guy to have around and not having him this week has been tough. He's been there since I've been part of the Scotland squad and that's the case for a lot of the boys.
We've got a strong group of leaders in the squad. Obviously Greig was the main one so with him being absent other guys in the squad have had to step up this week. I'm not the sort of guy who likes standing up and speaking in front of a group of people but on the pitch your scrum-halves and fly-halves need to be leaders.

I've felt this week I've had to do some of what Greig does in giving a little bit of direction to others.
Ali Price, Henry Pyrgos and I are used to talking things through at Glasgow about what is working and what isn't, so in the absence of Greig we have tried to come together as a group to chat things through.
The good thing is the three of us and Duncan Weir have all played together a lot so we'll have a good 9-10 connection whatever the half-back combination is at any point in the game.
Wales have been impressive in this Six Nations and we know what a huge challenge they will provide at Murrayfield. They were very good against Italy and were unfortunate not to beat England in Cardiff, losing in almost the last play of the game. They are a quality team.
It will be another very physical game but there will be a few things the Welsh will throw at us that France and Ireland didn't. We'll have to be smart as well as physical.
One positive we can take from the France game is maintaining the clinical edge we have brought to our game in recent times. Our chance conversion rate in the tournament so far has been good and we'll need to take our chances when they come along on Saturday because Wales are not the type of team who allow you too many glimpses of their try-line.

Wales are one win from two as well so they are in the same situation as us. They'll have been gutted after the England defeat having come so close to winning. There is a lot riding on this match for both teams.

795,"The reigning world champion, Nico Rosberg, has walked off into the sunset. The cars have evolved, with new rules allowing them to become bigger, faster and more aggressive-looking.
But the most significant transformation has taken place behind the scenes.
Formula 1 is under new ownership. Control has passed from private equity firm CVC Capital Partners to the US group Liberty Media.
As a result, former chief executive Bernie Ecclestone, the man who is credited with turning F1 into one of the world's most lucrative sports, has finally stepped down at the age of 86.
The new chief executive is Chase Carey, a veteran of the US media industry and a former associate of Rupert Murdoch. He has already suggested that F1 ""needs a fresh start"".
So what might actually be changed?
In commercial terms, Formula 1 is a curious beast. It is certainly lucrative. In 2015, its revenues reached $1.7bn, according to motorsport analysts Formula Money. Yet teams towards the back of the grid often struggle to make ends meet.
Earlier this year, the Manor team finally closed down after several years of financial problems. Its collapse followed those of HRT and Caterham, who folded in 2012 and 2014 respectively.
And even as revenues have been rising, TV audiences have been falling.
The sport claimed 400 million viewers in 2016, down from a peak of 600 million in 2008. That may be partly due to a shift towards pay-TV in major markets such as the UK, Italy, France and Spain.
Formula 1 is an expensive business: even the smallest teams employ about 200 people, and it costs at least $100m just to get on to the starting grid. Remaining there, however, is the biggest challenge.
Small squads that don't win races and that don't get much television airtime often struggle to raise the sponsorship they need.
And although roughly half of F1's revenues are distributed among the teams, they are not divided equally.
Part of this is merit-based. The higher you finish in the World Championship, the more money you get. But some teams get extra bonuses, irrespective of how well they perform.
Ferrari, McLaren, Red Bull, Mercedes and Williams all get extra funding. And Ferrari gets more than $60m simply for turning up, because of its place in the sport's heritage.
The smaller teams think this is deeply unfair and argue that because in F1, success is heavily linked to financial resources, it distorts the competition. In 2015, the Sauber and Force India teams lodged a formal complaint with the European Commission.
Sauber team principal Monisha Kaltenborn says she hopes matters will change under Liberty Media.
Talks so far, she says, have been ""very encouraging"". Although altering the way payments are made would inevitably mean some of the larger teams getting less, she thinks they will co-operate.
""Why shouldn't it happen?"" she says. ""The big teams know that the show has to be a healthy show.
""If viewing figures continue to go down and we don't have that 'aha effect', sponsorship will go down and they will suffer equally, probably more, because they need more money to keep their operations going.""
Graeme Lowdon, a motor racing entrepreneur who helped to found the Manor team, agrees that a more level playing field is needed,
""What people want to see in F1 is a sport where skill is rewarded,"" he says.
""The sports that have grown in the past few years are the ones that are focused on parity, such as the NFL.""
Another area where change may be needed is in how F1 reaches out to its fanbase.
In recent years, the sport has focused on maximising its revenues, but despite expanding into new markets, it has arguably failed to attract a new generation of enthusiasts.
Races have been held in countries with little or no F1 heritage or established audiences, but where governments have proved willing to pay ever-higher sanctioning fees in exchange for the glamour associated with hosting a grand prix.
At the same time, fewer events have been held in the sport's European heartlands, where organisers are less willing to pay more than $30m for the privilege.
Liberty Media appears keen to reverse that trend and introduce new races in the United States, in an effort to broaden the sport's appeal.
That could mean getting rid of lucrative but controversial events like the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, which Liberty Media's chief executive Greg Maffei recently said ""does nothing to build the long-term brand and health of the business"".
However, according to Formula Money's Christian Sylt, that strategy may not work if F1 wants to keep its revenues at their current level.
""I do not believe there is a 'big ticket' alternative revenue stream to race hosting fees"", he says.
But perhaps the biggest challenge of all is to bring in a new generation of enthusiasts.
""We need to do something to connect with younger fans,"" says Sauber's Monisha Kaltenborn. ""You know, we don't want people who are just 40-something watching the sport. We have to go into digital media and social media far more.
""That's not a question about instantly making money, but it's about positioning yourself towards young people, so that tomorrow they'll come and watch a race.""
Former Jordan team commercial manager Ian Phillips puts it even more bluntly. ""At the moment Formula 1, it hurts me to say it, is just not that exciting,"" he says.
The problem, he thinks, is cost. Champions Mercedes spend upwards of $400m a year on their cars, and other teams simply can't compete. So the racing becomes boring.
""I have a 13-year-old son who just watches the first lap, then he goes away,"" he says.
So wealthy F1 may be - but if it can't attract the kids, it may well find itself overtaken by other, more appealing sports before long.

796,"TJ Lane, 19, was recaptured early on Friday. Local police tweeted ""We got him... one more to go.""
Lane is serving three life sentences after pleading guilty to the murders in Chardon High School in February 2012.
Two other inmates escaped in the same incident, including 45-year-old convicted robber Clifford Opperud.
Details of how the men escaped from the Allen Oakwood Correctional Institution have not been released, but local media reported they scaled a fence during a recreation break.
At around 02:00 local time (06:00 GMT) the Lima Police Department confirmed that ""Thomas Michael 'TJ' Lane III is in custody.  He has been returned to the prison.""
Lane was armed with a pitchfork when he was recaptured, unconfirmed reports quoting police said.
The mother of one of Lane's victims earlier said she was fearful when she heard the news of his escape.
""I'm disgusted that it happened. I'm extremely scared and panic-stricken. I can't believe it"", said Dina Parmertor, whose son Daniel, 16, was among the dead.
Clifford Opperud, who was serving a sentence for aggravated robbery, burglary and kidnapping, was caught at around 04:20 local time (08:20 GMT), police said.
A third inmate briefly escaped before being recaptured, police spokesman Andy Green said.
Lane pleaded guilty last year to three counts of aggravated murder, two counts of attempted aggravated murder and one count of felonious assault.
He used a .22-calibre pistol to fire 10 shots at a group of students in Chardon High School's cafeteria, killing Demetrius Hewlin, 16, and Russell King, 17, as well as Daniel Parmertor.
Three others were wounded in the attack, which took place when Lane was 17.
Despite evidence he suffered psychosis and hallucinations, he was found competent to be tried as an adult.
During his trial, Lane smirked and smiled as victims' relatives spoke.

797,"It said Daniel was ""invisible"" at times and none of the professionals he came into contact with ever questioned him about what was happening in his life.
A number of the bodies cited in the review have responded to its findings.
Mr Lock said there were a number of features of Daniel's case which made it very unusual.
""Often abuse is about parental stress... reckless behaviour by parents, and the abuse of a child is a follow-on from that. In this case, it was premeditated and planned.
""Now that's quite rare and I think people actually struggled to believe what was happening.
""The other thing that was different was Daniel was scapegoated and was the only child in the family that suffered this level of abuse. That in itself is quite rare... so there was a reassurance that if the other children appeared well there must be something else to explain away what was happening to Daniel.
""There is a rule of optimism that prevails. I think there were too many occasions when, for instance, mum said, 'We've stopped drinking, the domestic violence has stopped.' There's an optimistic stance that can then allow the social worker or the police officer or the health practitioner to move on to their next case.
""There's no doubt that Daniel was the focus of professional concern... But he was not the focus of their interventions. I didn't see a record of any conversation with Daniel. I didn't see a time when someone sat down with him and tried to explore his wishes and his feelings.""
Ms Weir told the BBC she found the report ""disheartening, disappointing and worrying"".
""I think there were some things in the way that he presented which I suspect arose out of having been abused and neglected over many, many years... so that he was very controlled, did not speak very much. Of course, there was the issue about him mainly being Polish speaking.
""Clearly, that was difficult for professionals, but it's my opinion that should have been overcome and should have been seen through. He had that entitlement, that right to be heard, as did his sibling.
""In terms of his mother, I think there are significant issues about her and her partner, and partners previously, about deception, about trying to hoodwink the professionals.
""Above all, going forward nationally, we've really got to get this message across to all professionals… they have got to see the child as the main element of their focus.""
Ms Binyon said that while ""no one professional, or professional group, was to blame for this, we didn't do enough working across the service"".
""The doctor that Daniel saw was a very experienced community paediatrician and he was faced with information which suggested that Daniel was losing weight despite the fact that he was eating. And also, when he did his own assessment, including examination, he saw no signs, there were no bruises on the child when he saw him.
""Every experienced doctor would always have child abuse in the back of their mind. At that time, when he saw him, that wasn't what the symptoms and signs were leading him to investigate.
""In the trust, we see at least one child a week referred with low weight, and the vast majority of those will turn out to have physical illness and the information that's being given by the parents and carers will be accurate and correct. So I think that was the starting position for the paediatrician.
""Unfortunately, he was killed before he was able to pursue his investigation, when he would have reached the different conclusion.""
Mr Reeves said every agency in Coventry ""needs to stand up and take responsibility individually and collectively for missed opportunities to have protected Daniel better"".
""We must have a situation whereby people will be able to stand back... join the dots up and make that decisive judgment call. Judgements which are really difficult, arguably impossible sometimes, about the right thing to do regarding a child and their family.
""There's absolutely no doubt that certainly slightly earlier in Daniel's tragically short life… the tone that was set of optimism with regard to what was being told to them should have been challenged and should have been arguably more pessimistic.
""The overriding emotion genuinely [now]… is a determination. We don't vilify professionals... but we say, we're not going to have the same conversation in a year, two years' time about information that could have been shared more readily.
""We can never say that a situation like this will never occur again but we must be able to say that the same mistakes… mustn't be replicated.""
Mr Simmonds said there must be ""a culture of moral responsibility"" in which people know how to raise the alarm and feel confident they will be listened to.
""The proposed change in the law to strengthen the legal responsibility to report suspected abuse may be one element of driving the necessary cultural change.""
But he added: ""We must avoid creating a situation where the social care system is swamped with unnecessary referrals because professionals lack the courage or confidence to take responsibility, exercise their judgment and act appropriately.""
Police were called to 26 separate incidents at Daniel Pelka's home and Asst Ch Cons Garry Forsyth said more could have been done to see them in the round.
""As the serious case review points out, the police dealt reasonably well with all the incidents in isolation. What we didn't do so well was deal with them on a linked-up basis and we didn't actually do as much with Daniel as we perhaps had the opportunity to do.
""Clearly there are things that needed to be done better and we've made lots of effort to ensure that we've learned those lessons.
""In any domestic abuse case I want my officers to be really consciously aware that children who are involved in that are always a child protection consideration.""
""Whilst this serious case review judges that no single, specific failure led to his death, time and again we see a basic lack of real action to protect Daniel. Processes were followed correctly much of the time but processes alone do not save children.
""Excuses from Daniel's violent, drug-using and alcoholic parents were believed. Too often people failed to look at Daniel like they would their own child.
""He was clearly not okay and it's not clear if anyone sought to establish his feelings with him in his own language as his parents' excuses just didn't add up.""","The document discusses a serious case review of the death of Daniel Pelka, a child who was subjected to severe abuse and neglect. The review found that Daniel's case was unusual in that it was premeditated and planned, and that he was scapegoated and the only child in the family to suffer this level of abuse. The review also found that professionals did not adequately address Daniel's concerns and did not explore his wishes and feelings. Ms Weir, Ms Binyon, and Mr Reeves all expressed their opinions on the review and its findings, with Ms Weir stating that professionals should see the child as the main element of their focus. Mr Simmonds also discussed the need for a culture of moral responsibility in which people know how to raise the alarm and feel confident they will be listened to.

798,"""I don't like the way they treat their workers,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Ms Long-Bailey claimed Uber drivers were being ""exploited"" and should have the same rights as workers with permanent jobs.
Uber said its drivers liked ""being their own boss"".
Ms Long-Bailey told Today: ""I don't personally use Uber because I don't feel that it is morally acceptable but that's not to say they can't reform their practices.""
She added: ""I don't want to see companies model their operations on the Uber model.""
The San Francisco-based company argues that its drivers are not employees but self-employed contractors.
An Uber spokesman said: ""Millions of people rely on Uber to get around and tens of thousands of drivers use our app to make money on their own terms.
""Almost all taxi and private hire drivers have been self-employed for decades before our app existed and with Uber they have more control.
""Drivers are totally free to choose if, when and where they drive with no shifts or minimum hours. In fact the main reason people say they sign up to drive with Uber is so they can be their own boss.
""Drivers using Uber made average fares of Â£15 per hour last year after our service fee and, even after costs, the average driver took home well over the National Living Wage.
""We're also proud to have moved things on from this industry's cash-in-hand past since every fare is electronically recorded, traceable and transparent.""
An employment tribunal last year ruled that Uber drivers were entitled to holiday pay, paid rest breaks and the national minimum wage.
The tribunal described Uber's claim that its London operation was a network of 30,000 small businesses linked by a common technology platform as ""faintly ridiculous"".
The company's appeal against the employment tribunal decision will be heard later this year.
The tribunal said Uber drivers were not employees in the traditional sense, so were not entitled to the full range of employment rights, but could be classed as workers while they were using the Uber app and so were entitled to the minimum wage.
A government commissioned report by Tony Blair's former adviser, Matthew Taylor, recommends creating a new category of worker called a ""dependent contractor"", who should be given extra protections by firms such as Uber and Deliveroo.
But Ms Long-Bailey said this would not necessarily help them.
""We don't really need a new status, the court victories that we've far have proved that many of these so-called self-employed people who work for the likes of Uber, for example, are workers and should be given adequate protections.
""And I do worry that if this isn't dealt with in sufficient detail, it could undermine the court rulings of Uber, for example, which it was hoped to have wide-ranging implications for the industry.""
Ms Long-Bailey's deputy, shadow business minister Chi Onwurah, said she used Uber, but would have to reconsider if workers' rights were not strengthened.
The Labour MP told Sky News: ""These services bring real benefits to people. As a single woman leaving a meeting at 11 o'clock at night, being able to trace and see that your Uber is approaching is a benefit.
""We are not putting the blame on consumers and users of these applications.""
But, she added, ""if the regulatory form doesn't come through then I would find it very hard to use Uber or Deliveroo because it is important that we support strong working rights"".","Labour Party leader Ms Long-Bailey has criticized Uber for exploiting its drivers and called for them to have the same rights as workers with permanent jobs.

Earlier he said the surgery had already taken place and been successful, but he later corrected his statement.
Mrs Gandhi, 64, is seen as India's most powerful politician. She holds no official post, but many consider her the de facto head of the government.
The announcement has taken India by surprise. It is not clear where Mrs Gandhi has gone - the Press Trust of India, quoting Congress party sources, reports that she left for the US on Wednesday.
The BBC's Mark Dummett in Delhi says her absence comes at a critical time for the government as it deals with corruption scandals and high price rises.
India has some of the best medical facilities and doctors in the world and speculation is rife as to why Mrs Gandhi chose to go elsewhere for surgery.
Some reports suggest she may need specialist treatment not yet available in India, but these are unconfirmed.
Other people wonder whether Mrs Gandhi wants to avoid the inevitable media circus there would be, were she to attend a hospital in India.
Mr Dwivedi did not say what the operation was for, nor where it would take place.
""Sonia Gandhi has been recently diagnosed with a medical condition that requires surgery... She has travelled abroad and is likely to be away for two to three weeks,"" he told reporters.
Earlier the spokesman said that she had already had a successful operation in the US, but later corrected his mistake, saying it would take place in the next two to three days.
Mrs Gandhi has named a four-member team to run party affairs during her absence, he said. The team includes her son and MP Rahul Gandhi, who is tipped as a future prime minister.
Mrs Gandhi's absence from the opening session on Monday was remarked upon in the Indian media, but explained by a ""viral infection"" from which she was said to be suffering.
Italian-born Mrs Gandhi is the widow of former Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi. She nominated Manmohan Singh to the prime minister's post in 2004 and is widely believed to be more powerful than him.

Nick Clegg quit as leader after his party was left with eight MPs and a new leader will be elected in July.
The party's former president, Tim Farron, is also seen as one of the frontrunners to become leader.
Mr Lamb, who held his seat with a reduced majority of 4,043, said the general election had been ""absolutely punishing"" for his party.
He told BBC Look East he made his decision to stand after ""an awful lot"" of soul-searching in a period of ""complete exhaustion"" after the election.
But he concluded he should do it, he said, as ""obviously the party suffered devastating results last Thursday. It's critically important that we reconnect and... have an effective advocate for what modern liberalism is all about.""
He added: ""As health minister I put body and soul into it and I would do the same for this job.""
Mr Lamb told Radio 4's Today programme the public's confidence in his party had been severely damaged by its decision to go back on a pledge, made before the 2010 election, to oppose any increase in university tuition fees.
Mr Lamb voted in favour of the increase in fees to Â£9,000 in December 2010 when he was a whip in the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government.
""Trust for me is critically important and that debacle massively undermined people's trust in the party,"" Mr Lamb said.
""I believe very strongly that we have now learned a massive lesson, an extremely painful one. But I don't think we will ever make that mistake again.""
The Liberal Democrats have set in motion a two-month contest to succeed Mr Clegg after they said a new leader would be elected in July.
Mr Farron, who voted against the tuition fees increase, said his party must ""turn our anger into action"" and rebuild from the bottom upwards. He said he felt a sense of anger the election had been fought ""on the politics of fear"".
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Farron added: ""When one looks back at the election and you realise that the best asset David Cameron has is the SNP and the best asset the SNP has is David Cameron.""
It was an election fought on the basis of people being terrified of the other, he said.
""Fear is a hugely motivating factor in elections, I'm sad to report.""

802,"According to the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO)
, the current system of oil price reporting is ""susceptible to manipulation or distortion.""
Benchmark prices are compiled by price reporting agencies.  The biggest, Platts, says ""there is absolutely no similarity"" between Libor and oil.
Trillions of dollars of securities and contracts are based on these oil and gasoline prices.
Both the Libor inter-bank lending rate at the heart of a global rate-rigging scandal and spot oil prices are based on a system of trust.  They are, effectively, unregulated.
Traders at various banks voluntarily report the prices they pay for oil contracts to Platts, Argus or one of their competitors.  The price reporting agency use a number of trades to decide what the benchmark price, quoted to the outside world, should be.
IOSCO said that ""this creates opportunity for a trader to submit a partial picture, i.e. an incomplete set of its trades in order to influence the assessment to the trader's advantage.""
Journalists working at Platts or Argus are trained to check any figures which appear suspicious or spurious.   However, they do not have powers to challenge or investigate banks or individuals responsible for these submissions.
Platts - the biggest player in the market - insists that the competition between it and Argus as Independent Price Reporting Organisations (IPROs) provides ""critical distinctions"" from Libor which is regulated by a single body, the British Bankers' Association.
IOSCO also criticised a lack of transparency about the way banks compile their submissions. Platts says the data is based on ""bids and offers that are tested in the marketplace."" However, IOSCO raises the issue that there are insufficient safeguards to prevent collusion between two or more banks as is currently suspected in the Libor scandal.
The G20 had originally asked IOSCO, oil cartel OPEC, the International Energy Agency and the International Energy Forum to contribute to a report into oil price reporting in March.
But, the Global Financial Markets Association (GFMA) - which represents large financial organisations - is also critical of the perceived independence of Platts and its competitors:  Argus, OPIS and ICIS-LOR, which also compile oil and gasoline prices for the market.
In its statement, Platts said: ""Platts and other IPROs have no vested interest in the markets they cover. We are subscription-based companies and never pay in any fashion for market participants to submit data to our assessment processes.""
However, Simon Lewis, chief executive of the GFMA wrote in an open letter to IOSCO: ""there is potential for conflicts of interest to arise where PRAs engage in revenue generation, price reporting and news services on oil markets, as incentives may arise to favour those who pay greater subscriber fees or provide greater access to market information.""
Mr Lewis called for ""barriers or fire walls to minimize contamination risk of information.""

803,"Reports seen by the BBC state former chief executive Mike Owen and head of children's services Mark Carriline failed to act quickly enough after claims were made against a councillor.
Simon Carter later admitted 16 charges of making indecent images of children.
Mr Owen apologised for any errors but denied any political motivation.
Mr Carriline could not be contacted while Mike Connolly, the former council leader, declined to comment.
At an extraordinary meeting later, Bury councillors will vote on whether to publish the results of two independent reports into the council's handling of the situation.
The contents of those reports have, however, been seen by the BBC.
They found Mr Owen and Mr Carriline had ""inexplicably"" and ""deliberately"" delayed implementing safeguarding procedures when allegations about Carter first came to light in the spring of 2015.
The then Tottington councillor was on the adoption register at the time.
Later that year, Carter was given a three-year community sentence and placed on the sex offenders register for five years, at Bolton Crown Court.
Although Carter was immediately removed from the council's list of people approved to adopt children, the reports found Mr Owen and Mr Carriline waited up to five weeks to carry out a string of child protection measures that should have been implemented within 48 hours of the allegations being made.
That included taking eight days to inform the two schools where Carter was a governor.
Mr Owen quit the day before a disciplinary hearing while investigators found Mr Carriline guilty of serious misconduct and recommended his immediate dismissal, but he resigned before the recommendations were put before the council.
Mr Owen demonstrated a misguided desire to ""help"" Mr Connolly, investigators concluded, which manifested itself in inappropriate briefings, a desire to control the proper flow of information and a failure to adhere to the council's policies and procedures.
The disciplinary panel concluded this was a misguided attempt to protect the former administration and its leader Mr Connolly from public scrutiny in the run-up to the 2015 elections.
In relation to Mr Carriline, the disciplinary panel found he was overly compliant to Mr Owen and, in so doing, lost sight of his statutory duties.
Mr Owen told the BBC that he accepted his position as chief executive was ""untenable irrespective of the outcome of the [disciplinary] hearing"".
He said he had always denied ""any deliberate wrongdoing"", adding he was ""truly sorry"" for making ""procedural errors of judgment"".
He ""absolutely refuted abhorrent allegations"" that his actions were intended to ""help [Mr Connolly] and to impact the result of the election"".
Mr Connolly, who is still a councillor, told investigators he had been wrong to give Carter a written reference on council-headed notepaper ahead of his sentencing, describing him as ""trustworthy, honest and reliable"".

Two other activists Liu Yuandong and Sun Desheng were also jailed on Friday.
Yang Maodong had helped organise a press freedom protest outside the Southern Weekly in Guangzhou in January 2013, after its reporters complained that the newspaper's New Year message urging stricter adherence to the constitution had been changed by censors.
He also encouraged activists to hold up placards in several other cities.
Mr Yang, who had previously been imprisoned for five years after campaigning against corruption, has been held in detention for two years since his arrest, amid boycotts by his lawyers over procedural issues.
Mr Yang's lawyer, Zhang Lei, told Reuters on Friday: ""He wasn't guilty of anything at all. This sentence is unacceptable and unfair.""
Mr Yang's sister said the trial amounted to ""cruelty and political persecution"".
Another of his lawyers, Li Jinxing, said that minutes before the trial the court in Guangzhou had added a charge of provoking troubles, which allowed for a longer sentence.
Roseann Rife, East Asia research director at Amnesty International, said: ""It's a dark day when people advocating for press freedom and democracy are subjected to torture and other ill-treatment and sentenced to lengthy prison terms after sham trials.""
Sun Desheng was jailed for two and a half years and Liu Yuandong for three years for disturbing public order.
Chinese judicial officials have not commented on the sentences but in similar cases the foreign ministry has urged other nations to respect China's judicial sovereignty.
On Thursday, a court reduced the sentence of prominent journalist, Gao Yu, 71, for leaking state secrets from seven years to five and allowed her out of jail on medical grounds.","Guo Feixiong, also known as Yang Maodong, was sentenced to five years in prison for organizing a peaceful protest outside a newspaper office in Guangzhou in 2013.

Under that name she starred in the Nollywood film Lords of Money in 2015.
Her performance skills were put to good use on Sunday night when she celebrated her victory in acrobatic style in front of the cameras.
Nigeria's Paralympians already have six golds, two silvers and one bronze medal.
That's compared to Nigeria's Olympic team which only took home one bronze for football last month.
At the half-way point Nigeria's Paralympic team is 10th in the medal table and top among African countries, whereas the Olympians were joint 78th by the end.

A point not missed by some Nigerians on Twitter:
Before this Games, the former director of the National Sports Commission went as far as to say that he hoped the Paralympians would ""erase the shame of the dismal showing at the Olympic Games"", reports Nigeria's Daily Trust.
Weightlifter Lucy Ejike broke a world record on Sunday to win gold with a lift of 142kg in the women's under-61kg event.
It is the third time she has broken a world record - in Beijing in 2008 she broke two during the under-48kg event.
The 38-year-old wheelchair user has won three gold medals since she started competing in 2000.
Only one of Nigeria's nine medals is not in powerlifting - so far it has five Paralympic powerlifting golds, two silvers and one bronze.
That's added to 15 other powerlifting gold medals since Nigeria started competing in 1992.

This doesn't appear to be by accident.

813,"But the little pink tablets, to be sold under the brand name Addyi, have proven controversial. Here is what you need to know about what has been dubbed the ""female Viagra"".
That flibanserin - to use its chemical name - would draw comparison to its blockbuster male equivalent was inevitable but the nickname is misleading.
While a Viagra pill treats erectile dysfunction by improving blood flow to the penis, flibanserin was developed as an anti-depressant and boosts sexual desire by balancing chemicals in the brain.
Specifically, the drug treats hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), essentially a lack of libido that causes distress and is thought to affect between 5.5 million and 8.6 million US women.
By gaining approval, Addyi's makers Sprout succeeded where medical giants have failed.
Pfizer, Procter & Gamble and others have all tried to develop products treating low sexual desire in women.
While the product has its pros and cons, medical practitioners now have a new treatment available to treat a common condition.
Sprout plans to launch the product in mid-October. A rival, Palatin Technologies, has an alternative treatment for HSDD in late-stage trials.
Women taking the drug reported around one more sexually satisfying event a month, compared to a placebo.
But supporters say even this small benefit is worthwhile - ""I want to want my husband, it is that simple,'' said Amanda Parrish, one of the women involved in trials.
The FDA's approval of Addyi comes with tough safety measures, meaning that its usage is unlikely to be as widespread as with male Viagra.
Doctors will only be able to prescribe the drug after counselling patients about potential side-effects, including low blood pressure, nausea and fainting.
Pharmacists must remind patients not to drink alcohol while taking the drug, which can make the effects more severe.
And while Viagra can be taken shortly before having sex, Addyi must be taken daily.
""This is the biggest breakthrough in women's sexual health since the advent of 'the Pill' for contraception,"" The National Consumers League said in a statement.
Lobbying group Even the Score, which has campaigned for better treatment of women's sexual health, accused the FDA of gender bias, highlighting the numerous products available treating sexual dysfunction in men, although none of them treat low desire.
Some physicians have welcomed the approval too, such as Dr Lauren Streicher, associate professor of clinical obstetrics and gynaecology at Northwestern University.
""This is an enormous, enormous advance in women's health.
""Of all the sexual dysfunctions, this is by far the most common in every single age category and we've had no options for women up until now.""
Addyi's critics argue that the FDA has approved a drug of marginal impact with potentially serious side-effects. Previous versions of the drug have been rejected by the FDA.
""Unfortunately, we haven't heard the last of this drug,"" warned consumer group Public Citizen.
PharmedOut, which focuses on marketing in pharmaceuticals, said the FDA has been swayed by ""a clever, aggressive public relations campaign"".
""This opens the way for drug companies to pressure the FDA through public relations campaigns to approve more bad drugs: It's bad news for rational drug approval,"" Adriane Fugh-Berman, a pharmacology professor and director of PharmedOut told the Washington Post.
The medical status of HSDD has been disputed, with some arguing that low libido in women cannot be treated in the same way as erectile dysfunction in men.
""Women's sexuality is very complicated. It's not a matter of just taking that pill, by the way, and then all of a sudden the lights go on,"" Judy Kuriansky, a clinical psychologist and certified sex therapist, told CNN.","The FDA has approved the drug Addyi, also known as flibanserin, to treat hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in women.

816,"Writing in the journal Ecology Letters, conservationists have said that the big cats should be better protected from their main threat - humans.
They have proposed that fencing off the carnivores into nature reserves could protect them in the future.
The scheme would be expensive, costing about $500 (Â£300) per square kilometre.
But the authors of the paper said it would be more cost effective than some of the current projects that encourage humans to live alongside these animals.
Physical barriers
Africa's lions have suffered dramatic declines over the last 50 years.
Their numbers are estimated to have fallen by about 80% - and recent surveys suggest there could be as few as 20,000 to 30,000 of the big cats left in the wild.
Much of this loss has been blamed on humans.
Some of the big cats have been killed because they are perceived to be a threat to livestock, and competition for land and over-hunting of their prey have reduced their numbers even further.
Now conservationists have argued that separating wild lions from humans could be their only hope of survival.
They said that fencing off reserves in areas such as the Serengeti and South Africa's National Parks has helped the populations to grow, and now propose extending these schemes across Africa.
They say conserving wild lions in unfenced areas costs $2,000 (Â£1,300) per square kilometre, compared with an estimated $500 for the same efforts in enclosed regions.
The lead author of the paper Craig Packer, an ecologist from the University of Minnesota, said: ""It is clear that fences work and unfenced populations are extremely expensive to maintain.""
Managing wild animals in this way is an extreme measure, but conservationists are arguing that radical schemes are needed to save species from extinction.
Dr Luke Hunter, from the big cat conservation organisation Panthera, said: ""No one wants to resort to putting any more fences around Africa's marvellous wild areas, but without massive and immediate increases in the commitment to lion conservation, we may have little choice.""","Conservationists have proposed that big cats, such as lions, should be better protected from humans by fencing them off into nature reserves.

The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) has said the fish kill stretches over several kilometres.
A department spokesman said the cause is ""suspected to be silage effluent"".
Anglers reported dead fish in two separate locations on the river. One near Claudy village, the other much further downstream at Campsie, close to where the Faughan runs into the River Foyle.
The Loughs Agency said it was investigating whether there were two separate pollution events, or both were part of the same one.
Norman Henderson, from the Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA), said it would take many months for the river to recover.
""I've seen worse fish kills but this would be towards the top end,"" he said.
""It's a significant kill, there's no doubt about that. The latest figures we're getting from the Loughs Agency is several thousand dead fish,"" said Mr Henderson.
""We believe it is agricultural and we have narrowed it down to a particular part of the river and we are following a definite line of inquiry.
""It would obviously have to be a fairly strong effluent, something like silage.""
But there was no risk to public health, said Mr Henderson, who is a senior scientific officer with the NIEA.
""The river is safe in the sense that it has affected the fish but there is no risk to drinking water,"" he said.
""The river will recover, its difficult to put an exact timescale on it but you're certainly talking many months or possibly longer before the river is back to normal.
""Certainly the overall stocks in the river will still have taken a hit.""
The River Faughan is an important waterway for breeding salmon.
It also contains sea trout, trout, lamprey, eel and many other fish species.
East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell has written to the Environment Minister Michelle McIlveen seeking answers.
""This is a major pollution tragedy on the Faughan which is a well-known salmon and trout river in the North West for anglers,"" he said.
""The wider implications on this major fish kill for future generations of fish stock cannot be underestimated and it is imperative that the source of the pollution is found as soon as possible to minimise further losses.""

But there was also one nagging question. Why does a city and a country which have played such a huge part in the history of the computer, still produce so few world-class technology companies?
A strange question to ask, perhaps, in a lecture theatre packed with successful alumni of the lab, some from companies like ARM and CSR which have thrived in Cambridge. After all, this is a city where academia and business have combined very fruitfully in the past two decades.
But in a lecture on what he's learned about innovation, Mike Lynch - who's the founder of another Cambridge technology success story, Autonomy - bemoaned the fact that all the brilliant work done by the university's scientists had failed to translate into many big hitters in the FTSE-100.
Just one UK computer business had made it into the FTSE, he told us, and that was Sage, the Newcastle-based accountancy software firm. ""Our universities are second to none,"" he said. ""But they're failing to translate the gold coming out of them into economic growth.""
(It now strikes me that Dr Lynch is ignoring the fact that the chip designer ARM is in the top third of the FTSE-100 - but maybe he doesn't count it as a computing company?)
He suggested that many companies with excellent technology got to a certain stage and then they or their backers lost confidence, selling up to American firms. We were, he suggested, producing great R&D labs for overseas firms to exploit rather than going on to turn high quality research into products for global markets.
Dr Lynch, of course, eventually sold Autonomy to America's Hewlett Packard and is now embroiled in a row over just what his company was really worth. But his point was that more firms needed to stay independent long enough to create a lasting infrastructure in Britain, even if they ended up in foreign ownership.
Others in the audience then joined a discussion about the way forward. Lord Broers, a distinguished engineer and former vice-chancellor of Cambridge University, was worried by how little we spent on research and development as a country compared to rivals - 1.7% of GDP in the UK, as compared to 2.8% in Germany and 2.9% in the United States. ""We're underspending by billions, mainly in industry,"" he said.
There were the usual worries about a gap in capital for technology companies - plenty at the start, then very little when they wanted to make the leap into the big league. And there were calls for government to to think more about using its own procurement budgets to help UK firms in the way the US did - for the different tech clusters, from Cambridge to Bristol to London's TechCity, to collaborate better; even for The Sun newspaper to start celebrating computer scientists on page three.
Mike Lynch's main concern, however, was about the teaching of STEM subjects - science, technology, engineering and maths - in secondary schools where he felt we were falling behind. He cited as an example the scarcity of girls taking A-Level physics.
We had brilliant graduates coming out of places like the Cambridge computing laboratory, he said, but that supply could dry up, and we needed a wider hinterland of skilled people. Those worries about a skills gap opening up are now commonplace amongst many in Britain's hi-tech industries.
But  Cambridge, the birthplace of computers from the Edsac to the BBC Micro, has at least produced an attempt to address that problem with the Raspberry Pi, which aims to inspire a new generation of computer scientists.
That continuing spirit of innovation should provide some cause for optimism that we can find ways of turning world-class science into world-beating businesses.","The 75th anniversary of the Cambridge University computer laboratory was marked by a discussion on why the UK, despite its history in the computer industry, produces few world-class technology companies.

The country is still reeling from the murder of 26-year-old Jordanian air force pilot Moaz al Kasasbeh by Islamic State (IS) last week.
King Abdullah has vowed to wage a ""harsh"" war against IS, and fighter jets from Jordan have carried out fresh attacks on the militants, who control parts of neighbouring Syria and Iraq.
Following his arrival, Prince Charles met Christian refugees from Iraq at the British ambassador's residence in Amman.
Remarking on the rise of IS, Charles told them: ""This is what I think must be the worst of horrors - when all the people you lived with, side by side, and have always been friendly [with], suddenly totally change.""

The Peak District National Park Authority said it expects to charge about £1,200 per month for the three-bedroom property.
It appears to be the second time the property has been listed this year.
Thornfield Hall was the home of the 1847 novel's hero Edward Rochester.
Its real-life counterpart is said to have been visited by Charlotte Bronte several times while staying with a friend.
North Lees Hall is, according to an estate agent's blurb, ""situated in spectacular countryside"" with ""stunning historic features of the Elizabethan era"".
It has three double bedrooms, two living rooms, and, true to its historic character, also boasts oil-powered central heating.
By comparison, the average rental for a three-bedroom house in Bexley, south-east London, is £1,548 per month.
It was opened up to the public last year to coincide with the 200th anniversary of the author's birth.
The building was taken over by the Peak District National Park Authority after the Vivat Trust, which had managed it since 1988, stopped trading in July 2015.

830,"Throughout this time, the artist has opted to remain anonymous, only revealing her gender, despite the sculptures receiving international attention.
This year, a final, collaborative work was unveiled at the Edinburgh Book Festival.
Standing at 2m (6ft 6in) tall, it takes the shape of a tree, the leaves formed of butterflies, and a child clutching the trunk with a book in hand.
The public was invited by the artist to contribute their own paper butterflies to the sculpture, resulting in donations from the UK, Spain, Germany, Greece and the US.
Speaking to BBC Scotland via Twitter, where she goes by the name Freetofly, the sculptor said: ""It's been obvious since the start of the project five years ago that there is a world of people who care about public libraries and universal access to literacy.
""The collaboration was a way of us joining our voices together.
""I'm pretty sure this is the final piece. I meant to end it after the 10th, but there was always a really good reason to keep going and make one more. Enough though now. More than enough maybe!""
The first of what would become a series of mystery sculptures - a paper tree nicknamed The Poetree - was found by staff in the Scottish Poetry Library in March 2011.
A further 10 were discovered over the course of that year, their location always connected to literature: libraries, bookshops and museums. Attached to each creation was a note, many of them reading ""a gift in support of libraries, book, words and ideas"".
The eleventh sculpture was delivered to an independent bookshop in Edinburgh, addressed to Scots author Ian Rankin.
In a 2015 interview, conducted by email to preserve anonymity, the woman said: ""I didn't have a plan when I left the pieces. I chose places I love. I made works that I thought suited them, added tags with what I suppose is my mission statement, and placed them in situ.""
In August 2014, a sculpture was covertly donated to the Macmillan Cancer Support Arts Exhibition, and put up for auction. The work was bought by the Mackenzie family from Edinburgh.
Dr Colin Mackenzie, concluding he couldn't ""sit and admire it all day"", decided to take the work on a not-for-profit tour of Scotland to raise awareness of the art.
During the tour, he said the artist made it known she was happy to do one final sculpture, and Dr Mackenzie then became the postal address for the paper butterflies.
Speaking to BBC Scotland at the Edinburgh Book Festival, he said: ""I share a tremendous sadness with many about this being the last paper sculpture, but it's part of the story, and part of the art.
""The mystery of the artist is a fantastic story, and she'll leave a legacy of generosity. Not everyone is in it for themselves.""
To the artist, the end of her project seems to be of less importance than the message shared.
She said: ""I'm okay about it ending. I've always wanted the attention to be on the message really, that libraries are important resources, and reading matters.
""Having a building free to enter that is outside your home resourced and expertly staffed confers on us all a certain status - that we are valued.

831,"If it's a CD or vinyl, you've a choice between a high street store or an online retailer like Amazon. If it's a digital download, you're most likely to be buying it from iTunes.
Now Amazon is launching a service designed to make it a one-stop shop for physical and digital music products. And that raises the question - why on earth have its rivals sat and watched this happen?
Amazon's new AutoRip service means that whenever you buy a CD or a vinyl album you also get free mp3 versions. What is more, customers who have bought physical music from the online retailer in the past will find that it is now all available in digital form in Amazon's CloudPlayer.
This could be rather scary - Amazon started selling CDs in the UK back in 1999, and you may find the evidence of your past musical tastes rather distressing.
But how attractive will this feature really be? You might think most music fans were rapidly abandoning CDs for digital downloads, so that this kind of hybrid service would soon be irrelevant.
Paul Firth, head of music for Amazon UK, tells me he's confident there is a large body of consumers for whom Autorip will be attractive. The company still shifts a lot of CDs, and the sales are growing in the UK, which means that it has a growing share of a shrinking market.
In the US, where the service has been live since January, it has helped grow sales - those CDs which are licensed for Autorip are selling faster than those that aren't.
""It gives us a better customer offer,"" says Mr Firth.""We're uniquely placed to offer people the chance to listen to what they want across both physical and digital.""
So an American business which is already the dominant force in book retailing in the UK, both physical and digital, is now bidding to carve out a big slice of the music market too. Of course another American firm, Apple, will have plenty to say about that - but it's worth asking why no British retailer is in the running.
We have some of the world's most successful artists, and a great music culture , but we've failed to develop a company that could adapt to the digital age and rival Apple and Amazon in the business of selling music to consumers.
There was one obvious candidate. Back in the mid-90s when Amazon got underway, this UK firm was a retail powerhouse, selling music, videos and books, and with ties to a major music label.
It continued to grow into the next decade, and while it was somewhat slow to spot the threat from digital competition, it did then launch a major drive to modernise the way it engaged with consumers, as explained in the company's 2008 Annual Report: ""As digital delivery becomes a reality across a wider range of our product categories,"" it said, ""we are now poised to grow faster.""
That company was HMV, which went into administration in January this year. Sadly its various efforts at selling music online or offering downloads with physical purchases to selected customers were too little, too late, and never added up to a coherent digital strategy.
For too long, the company focussed on holding on to what it had - a profitable high street operation - rather than advancing onto new territory. Of course, in that HMV is far from alone.
Worldwide, the incumbents in all kinds of industries threatened by digital disruption have gone through a cycle of complacency followed by mild concern and then panic - look at Kodak and its reaction to digital photography.
And some would point to another reason why American web giants can prosper at the expense of home-grown businesses. Amazon, as we've all heard recently, is among those companies making use of perfectly legal tax avoidance measures to reduce its corporation tax payments to just £2.4m last year.
Independent bookshops are already angry about competition from a firm they see as enjoying an unfair advantage. Now the UK's remaining record stores - including HMV's new owners - face a rival who can offer consumers CDs, vinyl and downloads all in one package at a very keen price. Music fans may still have a sentimental attachment to the record stores - but who would bet against them spending their money with Amazon?","Amazon is launching a new service called AutoRip which allows customers to get free mp3 versions of CDs and vinyl albums they purchase from the online retailer.

833,"In experiments, they demonstrated that the virus was transmitted from pigs to monkeys without any direct contact between them.
The researchers say they believe that limited airborne transmission might be contributing to the spread of the disease in some parts of Africa.
They are concerned that pigs might be a natural host for the lethal infection.
Ebola viruses cause fatal haemorrhagic fevers in humans and many other species of non human primates.
Details of the research were published in the journal Scientific Reports.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the infection gets into humans through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs and other bodily fluids from a number of species including chimpanzees, gorillas and forest antelope.
The fruit bat has long been considered the natural reservoir of the infection. But a growing body of experimental evidence suggests that pigs, both wild and domestic, could be a hidden source of Ebola Zaire - the most deadly form of the virus.
Now, researchers from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and the country's Public Health Agency have shown that pigs infected with this form of Ebola can pass the disease on to macaques without any direct contact between the species.
In their experiments, the pigs carrying the virus were housed in pens with the monkeys in close proximity but separated by a wire barrier. After eight days, some of the macaques were showing clinical signs typical of ebola and were euthanised.
One possibility is that the monkeys became infected by inhaling large aerosol droplets produced from the respiratory tracts of the pigs.
One of the scientists involved is Dr Gary Kobinger from the National Microbiology Laboratory at the Public Health Agency of Canada. He told BBC News this was the most likely route of the infection.
""What we suspect is happening is large droplets - they can stay in the air, but not long, they don't go far,"" he explained.
""But they can be absorbed in the airway and this is how the infection starts, and this is what we think, because we saw a lot of evidence in the lungs of the non-human primates that the virus got in that way.""
The scientists say that their findings could explain why some pig farmers in the Philippines had antibodies in their system for the presence of a different version of the infection called Ebola Reston. The farmers had not been involved in slaughtering the pigs and had no known contact with contaminated tissues.
Dr Kobinger stresses that the transmission in the air is not similar to influenza or other infections. He points to the experience of most human outbreaks in Africa.
""The reality is that they are contained and they remain local, if it was really an airborne virus like influenza is it would spread all over the place, and that's not happening.""
The authors believe that more work needs to be done to clarify the role of wild and domestic pigs in spreading the virus. There have been anecdotal accounts of pigs dying at the start of human outbreaks. Dr Kobinger believes that if pigs do play a part, it could help contain the virus.
""If they do play a role in human outbreaks it would be a very easy point to intervene"" he said. ""It would be easier to vaccinate pigs against Ebola than humans.""
Other experts in the field were concerned about the idea that Ebola was susceptible to being transmitted by air even if the distance the virus could travel was limited. Dr Larry Zeitlin is the president of Mapp Biopharmaceuticals.
""It's an impressive study that not only raises questions about the reservoir of Ebola in the wild, but more importantly elevates concerns about ebola as a public health threat,"" he told BBC News. ""The thought of airborne transmission is pretty frightening.""
At present, an outbreak of ebola in Uganda has killed at least two people near the capital Kampala.  Last month, Uganda declared itself Ebola-free after an earlier outbreak of the disease killed at least sixteen people in the west of the country.","Researchers from Canada have shown that pigs infected with the deadly Ebola Zaire virus can transmit the disease to macaques without any direct contact.

Abortion is legal in the US, but more recently several Republican states have passed stringent abortion laws.
Some US women have voiced concerns that their abortion rights could be revoked.
""There is a lot of fear and worry that, with the current administration and restrictions that are to the enormous disadvantage of girls and women, that access to clinical care might further diminish,"" Kinga Jelinska, the group's executive director, told the Washington Post.
Women Help Women already advises women around the world on how to take mifepristone, which blocks pregnancy development, and misoprostol, which induces miscarriage.
The two drugs, approved by the Food and Drug Administration, are used in combination until the 10th week of pregnancy, but must be administered by a health care clinician.
On Thursday, the group launched a new section called Self-Managed Abortions; Safe and Supported (SASS), which features counsellors who can provide support in real-time and make sure that self-induced abortions are ""medically and legally safe as possible"", according to the website.

The counsellors, who are trained by medical professionals, will also direct women to clinics or foundations that can help them pay for an abortion at a clinic.
The group, however, will not provide abortion drugs to women in the US.
Anti-abortion activists argue that using the drug without medical supervision can lead to serious complications.

But Southend ended the first half the stronger as Wordsworth flashed one effort wide from 15 yards and saw a 25-yard rocket tipped over by a flying Etheridge.
The second half was much quieter but Etheridge made a sprawling save to foil the clean-through Stephen McLaughlin after a mix-up between Walsall defenders Matt Preston and Jason McCarthy.
Walsall almost snatched the points eight minutes from time but Shrimpers keeper Mark Oxley beat away Kieron Morris' 20-yarder.

""It helped us remember why we wanted to be vets,"" said 21-year-old student Lucy Hicklenton.
""Although we spend a lot of time with dogs, they are usually used as educational tools as part of a lesson.""
Ms Hicklenton added: ""We all really like animals. It was a fun way and a different way for people to have an excuse not to revise.""
She is one of 48 students at the UK's newest school of veterinary medicine, which opened its doors in September.
The first-year exams start in just over a week and the students are nervous.

She enlisted the help of the local branch of Pets as Therapy (Pat). A team of nine dogs and their owners took over a room in the university and 30 first-year veterinary students turned up to meet them.
The dogs usually work with patients in care homes and hospitals but coped well with their new role.
""This was an unusual request,"" said Bridget Roberts, a Pat dog supporter who is also the university's clinical skills laboratory manager.

837,"The protoype consists of a soft pouch, containing aluminium for one electrode and a graphite foam for the other - all surrounded by a special liquid salt.
It can recharge in less than a minute and is very safe and durable compared to lithium-ion batteries, but currently only delivers about half the voltage.
The work appears in the journal Nature.
The researchers say it has advantages over lithium-ion batteries, common in electronic devices like smartphones, as well as traditional alkaline batteries.
Other scientists have said the work is exciting but still at a very early stage.
""We have developed a rechargeable aluminium battery that may replace existing storage devices, such as alkaline batteries, which are bad for the environment, and lithium-ion batteries, which occasionally burst into flames,"" said senior author Prof Hongjie Dai from Stanford University in California.
""Our new battery won't catch fire, even if you drill through it.""
In fact, a video made by the research team shows that the battery even continues to work for a short period after being punished in this way.
We may not expect batteries to withstand such treatment routinely - but this demonstration certainly sets the new design apart from lithium-ion batteries, which have faced safety concerns including recent bans on air transport.
Because it is lightweight and inexpensive, aluminium has attracted interest from battery engineers for many years, but it has never yielded a viable product.
Key to the new discovery was the choice of material for the other, positive electrode (the cathode) to go with aluminium for the negative electrode (or anode). Graphite - a form of carbon in which the atoms form thin, flat sheets - turned out to deliver very good performance, while also being similarly lightweight, cheap and widely available.
To connect the two electrodes, the pouch is filled with liquid.
""The electrolyte is basically a salt that's liquid at room temperature, so it's very safe,"" said PhD student Ming Gong, another of the study's authors. This contrasts with the flammable electrolytes used in lithium-ion batteries.
The battery performed particularly well when the team made the graphite cathode into a foam: a sponge-like pattern of tiny whiskers of the stuff, surrounding many empty pockets. This allows ions in the electrolyte solution very easy access to the graphite, helping the battery to work faster.
When the battery discharges, aluminium dissolves at the anode, while aluminium-containing ions slide into the spaces between atomic graphite layers at the cathode. When it charges again, the reverse occurs, depositing metallic aluminium metal back on the anode.
Crucially, this can take place through more than 7,500 complete cycles without the battery losing any capacity - several times more than most lithium-ion batteries, and hundreds of times better than any previous experimental designs that used aluminium.
Similarly, the device's two-volt output is the best seen from an aluminium battery. It is also better than common 1.5-volt alkaline batteries, but lags behind the output of the lithium-ion batteries we use in smartphones and laptops.
""Our battery produces about half the voltage of a typical lithium battery,"" Prof Dai said. ""But improving the cathode material could eventually increase the voltage and energy density.""
Nonetheless, his team has high hopes for their design. Already, just by strapping two of the pouch batteries together and plugging them into an adaptor, they managed to charge up a smartphone in a minute.
They also suggest it could be very useful in flexible displays, one of the proposals for the next generation of electronics.
Prof Dai clearly believes its voltage is the battery's single main limitation: ""Our battery has everything else you'd dream that a battery should have: inexpensive electrodes, good safety, high-speed charging, flexibility and long cycle life.
""I see this as a new battery in its early days. It's quite exciting.""
Clare Grey, a materials chemist at the University of Cambridge, said the work was ""definitely a step-change"" for aluminium batteries.
""Aluminium batteries are very difficult technology and I think their method of storing the charges inside the graphite is rather clever,"" Prof Grey told BBC News.
But she added that turning the prototype into a larger commercial product would be challenging. One problem is that the process of squeezing ions in between the graphite sheets can cause the material to expand and contract, which is ""bad news for the battery"", Prof Grey explained.
""And then also, the bigger the graphite sheets are, the further the ions have got to diffuse in - so the slower it gets. So part of reason it's got this high rate is that it's got very small platelets of graphite.""
She was impressed by the concept and the demonstration of the new design, however.
""I think it's very exciting and it gives new pointers as to how one might get that type of chemistry to work,"" Prof Grey said.

839,"Goldenbridge Cemetery in Dublin was the first non-denominational graveyard on the island of Ireland - and was used by people of all religions and none.
O'Connell, an MP who led the campaign to end religious discrimination against Catholics, opened Goldenbridge in 1828.
It shut over a dispute with the British War Office but reopened at the weekend.
Until now, the gates of the two-acre site in the Dublin suburb of Inchicore had been locked and visits were permitted by appointment only.
About 250 people attended a rededication ceremony at the graveyard on Sunday, which marked the opening of the site as a historical landmark and a working cemetery.
The attendees heard an extract from one of O'Connell's speeches, in which he said: ""We wish to live on terms of amity and affection with our brother Protestant fellow-countrymen.
""We earnestly desire to be united with them in our lives, and not to be separated from them in death"".
The Irish barrister and politician founded the graveyard at a time when Catholics were banned from having their own dedicated cemeteries.
They were also banned from taking seats in the House of Commons and many other public offices.
That began to change when O'Connell, a Catholic Irish nationalist from County Kerry, won a Commons seat to represent the County Clare constituency in 1828.
His election helped to pressurise the government into passing the 1829 Catholic Emancipation Act, which restored some of the civil liberties they had lost after the Reformation.
Goldenbridge cemetery is now run by the Glasnevin Trust, and members of the public will now be able to buy new grave plots at the site.
The trust is the largest provider of funeral services in the Republic of Ireland and is governed by the Dublin Cemeteries Committee, which O'Connell established in 1828.
The chairman of trust, John Green, told BBC News NI that the British military authorities originally objected to Goldenbridge over fears that the burials would contaminate their water supply.
He said the cemetery was close to Dublin's Grand Canal, which at that time was used as a source of drinking water by British troops based at nearby Richmond Barracks.
The complaint went all the way to the Lord Chancellor's office, before a decision was taken to shut the graveyard.
However, Mr Green added that an inspection of the site revealed it had good drainage, and said a more likely reason for the military objection was that troops frequently ended up in pubs with mourners after the many funerals held at the site.
The project to reopen the cemetery coincided with the refurbishment of Richmond Barracks as an exhibition centre.
Sunday's ceremony was held on the eve of the 170th anniversary of O'Connell's death and a wreath was laid in his memory.
Among the graves at Goldenbridge is that of first leader of the Irish Free State - William Thomas (WT) Cosgrave.
He served as the first President of the Executive Council - effectively the first Irish prime minister - from 1922 to 1932.
Cosgrave's legacy divides opinion and his grave has been vandalised in repeated attacks.
Last year, it was one of 12 graves badly damaged days before the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising.
However, at the time Mr Green told the BBC he could not be sure the vandalism was politically motivated, as the site was regularly a target for serious anti-social behaviour, including drug dealing.
It is hoped the reopened graveyard will have potential as a tourist attraction.","Goldenbridge Cemetery in Dublin, Ireland, was the first non-denominational graveyard on the island and was used by people of all religions and none.

It is to raise funds for Newman School in Rotherham which caters for a range of special educational needs and disabilities.
Mr Matthews described the plan as a birthday present to himself that would last 75 days.
""I like doing extreme distance challenges,"" he said.
His last distance challenge was to run 150 miles in 36 hours when he was 71.

The franchise will also be responsible for the West Coast Main Line.
Four bidders for the South Eastern franchise have also been announced.
In the case of the West Coast Partnership franchise all three bidders have a non-British partner.
The winner will be ""expected to work with HS2 Ltd to launch the first service on HS2"", said the DfT.
Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said the West Coast Partnership would help to ""ensure that HS2 becomes the backbone of Britain's railways"".
The West Coast Partnership is a new rail franchise which will combine the current InterCity West Coast main line with the planned HS2 high-speed services.
The operator will be responsible for services on both the West Coast main line from 2019 and running the initial HS2 services in 2026.
The West Coast franchise is currently run by Virgin Trains as a joint venture between Stagecoach and Virgin.
Some interesting elements to this.
There's the number of bidders for each franchise, three for the prestigious West Coast/HS2 partnership and four for the busy South Eastern franchise.
A few months ago the Public Accounts Committee said it feared the pool of companies wanting to run train lines was ""dwindling"" and the subsequent lack of competition could put costs up.
The government wants at least three bidders for each franchise and has managed that this time.
That's because there are some relative newcomers who are after a piece of the action. The Chinese Guangshen Railway Company is part of a bid to run the flagship HS2 line, due to open in 2026 and has never bid before. And two Japanese firms who want to help run South Eastern have only dipped their toe in recently on other franchises.
They join the usual suspects, including the French, Dutch and Italian state railways. The only government not allowed to bid to run British rail lines is our own.
First Trenitalia West Coast is a joint venture between First Rail Holdings and Italy's Trenitalia. Earlier this year it took on the C2C rail franchise.
MTR West Coast Partnership is a joint venture between Hong Kong's MTR Corporation and China's Guangshen Railway Company.
West Coast Partnership is a joint venture between Stagecoach Group, Virgin Holdings Ltd and France's  SNCF C3.
HS2 will run between London and Birmingham.
Construction will begin later this year and it is expected to reduce rail times between Birmingham and London by 32 minutes.
A second Y-shaped phase of HS2 will open in two stages.
The line from Birmingham to Crewe will launch in 2027, with the remaining construction - which includes a spur taking HS2 to a new station at Manchester Airport - due to finish six years later.

848,"The Criminal Finances Bill, which cleared the Commons on Tuesday, is meant to freeze the assets of foreign officials who abuse anti-corruption and human rights activists.
The law was prompted by the case of Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky.
He died in prison after revealing alleged fraud by state officials.
Mr Magnitsky,  legal adviser for London-based Hermitage Capital Management (HCM), had been jailed after he was accused of committing fraud himself. Supporters say his death in November 2009 was the result of a severe beating, but official records say he died of acute heart failure and toxic shock, caused by untreated pancreatitis.
Since his death, HCM's founder William Browder has been campaigning to bring to justice those he believes are responsible for what happened to Mr Magnitsky.
He had already managed to get the US to sign the Magnitsky Act into law in 2012, which promise to deny visas to and freeze assets in the US of 18 people linked to the lawyer's death by Mr Browder's investigation.
On Tuesday, he welcomed the third reading of the UK bill in the Commons as a ""huge triumph"" that would ""cause perceptible fear for kleptocrats in Russia and other authoritarian regimes"".
""They all have expensive properties in London and think they are untouchable,"" he said in a statement.
Speaking during the bill's reading, Security Minister Ben Wallace said: ""We need to make the UK a hostile environment for those seeking to move, hide and use the proceeds of crime and corruption. In an increasingly competitive international marketplace, the UK simply cannot afford to be seen as a haven for dirty money.""
He added: ""This measure would send a clear statement that the UK will not stand by and allow those who have committed gross abuse or violations around the world to launder their money here.""

The Old Bailey was told the assault by Saud Abdulaziz bin Nasser al Saud had a ""sexual element"" and he had attacked Mr Abdulaziz many times before.
Al Saud, 34, who had admitted manslaughter but denied murder, was given a minimum jail term of 20 years.
The Saudi prince was also found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent in relation to an earlier attack in a hotel lift, a charge which he had denied.
The murder of Mr Abdulaziz was the final act in a ""deeply abusive"" master-servant relationship in which Al Saud carried out frequent attacks on his aide ""for his own personal gratification"".
Judge Mr Justice Bean said: ""You were in a position of authority and trust over him which you exploited ruthlessly.
""I think the most likely explanation is that you could not care less whether you killed him or not.""
He continued: ""It is very unusual for a prince to be in the dock on a murder charge.
""It would be wrong for me to sentence you either more severely or more leniently because of your membership of the Saudi royal family.""
The 34-year-old was fuelled by champagne and cocktails when he bit his servant hard on both cheeks during the attack on 15 February, the court heard.
Jurors heard that Mr Abdulaziz was left so worn down and injured - having suffered a ""cauliflower"" ear and a swollen eye from previous assaults - that he let Al Saud kill him without a fight.
A gay masseur who visited him there described the ""dashing"" Al Saud as a cross between Omar Sharif and Nigel Havers.
The prince initially wrongly believed he had diplomatic immunity and his royal status would save him.
But he stood with his arms folded and showed no emotion as the judge told him he must serve 19 years, having already spent one on remand.
Mr Justice Bean added: ""No-one in this country is above the law.""

Riyad Mahrez curled in a masterful free-kick for 2-0 before half-time.
Mahrez smashed in a penalty after Jamie Vardy was brought down by the keeper, before Brugge's Jose Izquierdo hit the post, adding to his bad miss at 0-0.
There will be more difficult games than this, but the Premier League champions displayed a maturity and composure that suggests potential to achieve more success at the elite level of European club football.
This was only Leicester's ninth European match, and their first win since a victory over Glenavon of Northern Ireland in the preliminary round of the 1961-62 Cup Winners' Cup, when Gordon Banks - who won the World Cup with England in 1966 - was in goal.
Leicester could have won by more on Wednesday.
Danny Drinkwater went close with a dipping volley struck on the turn with the ball almost at ground level from outside the box, while Robert Huth might have added a fourth from another of Hernandez's several long throws.
Debutant and club record signing Islam Slimani should have made more of a terrible Benoit Poulain back pass, and was booked for shoving Bjorn Engels in the back, with the Belgium defender forced off with what looked like a dislocated shoulder.
In the other match in Group G, Portuguese club FC Porto drew 1-1 at home to FC Copenhagen of Denmark.
""It's impossible to win the Champions League,"" Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri said on Tuesday. ""There are so many big teams. To win it we have to write another fairytale.""
Eight years ago this September, Leicester supporters might have been looking forward to a decent run in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy after beating Hartlepool in the first round (they eventually lost to Rotherham in the Northern Section quarter-finals).
Now they are in with a good chance of making the Champions League knockout stages, but even if the Foxes do not make it out of the group, the fact they have made it to Europe's elite competition - and as champions of England - remains remarkable.
The hundreds of fans revelling under the historic gabled roofs of Brugge's sun-drenched squares may not have been able to explain how this moment had arrived, but there was plenty of infectious optimism. That same feeling was nurtured by Ranieri as he willed them to ""keep dreaming"" after last season's shock Premier League title win.
The away allocation was only 1,400 and although many others travelled despite not having tickets, they had been told they would be refused entry if they tried to buy tickets for the home section.
Albrighton's opener was the perfect start to what promises to be an intriguing campaign, but more than one slice of luck went Leicester's way in the early stages.
Moments before Albrighton profited from a mix-up between keeper Ludovic Butelle and midfielder Hans Vanaken, Brugge should have gone ahead themselves.
Wes Morgan was totally caught out by the pace of Izquierdo running on to a Vanaken through ball but the Colombian striker was wasteful, shooting wide with Kasper Schmeichel exposed.
The lead gave Leicester licence to adopt the formula that brought them so much success last season - sitting back and playing on the counter-attack.
Former Belgium goalkeeper Michel Preud'homme led Brugge to their first league title in 11 years last season.
But one win from their past five matches means they are 10th in the Belgian table and they never really threatened to break Leicester down once they had gone behind.
Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri, speaking to BT Sport: ""I said to the players when you hear the Champions League music it charges the battery and makes you fight.
""It was an important win for us after the Liverpool defeat. We scored very early and that gave us more confidence during all the match.
""Club Brugge moved the ball very well, they had the control of the ball but we had control of the match and that was good for us. Maybe at the beginning we surprised them.""
Leicester striker Jamie Vardy: ""It's the perfect start. We showed exactly what we can do. No fear, we just played our football and let that do the talking.""

859,"The announcement of plans by Deep Space Industries to exploit the rare metals present in the space rocks turns asteroid mining into a two-horse race.
The other venture, Planetary Resources, went public with its proposals last year.
Advocates of asteroid mining hope it could turn into a trillion-dollar business, but some scientists are highly sceptical of the idea.
Deep Space Industries wants to send a fleet of asteroid-prospecting spacecraft out into the Solar System to hunt for resources.
These spacecraft, which the company has dubbed ""Fireflies"", would use low-cost CubeSat components and benefit from discounted delivery to space by ride-sharing on the launch of larger communications satellites.
The Fireflies would have a mass of about 55 lb (25 kg) and be launched for the first time in 2015 on journeys of two to six months.
The company then wants to launch bigger spacecraft - which it calls ""Dragonflies"" - for round-trip visits that bring back samples.
These expeditions would take two to four years, depending on the target, and would return 60 to 150 lbs of material from target asteroids.
""Using resources harvested in space is the only way to afford permanent space development,"" said the company's chief executive David Gump.
""More than 900 new asteroids that pass near Earth are discovered every year. They can be like the Iron Range of Minnesota was for the Detroit car industry last century - a key resource located near where it was needed. In this case, metals and fuel from asteroids can expand the in-space industries of this century.""
Asteroids could yield precious minerals such as gold, platinum and rare-Earth metals. But some are also thought to harbour water ice, which could be used as a raw material for the manufacture of rocket propellant or even breathable air.
The other firm in the mining race, Planetary Resources, has backing from several billionaire investors, including Google's Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, software executive Charles Simonyi and filmmaker James Cameron.
That company wants to start by launching orbiting telescopes that would identify suitable asteroid targets for mineral exploitation.
However, some scientists struggle to see how cost-effective asteroid mining could be, even with the high value of gold and platinum.
They point out that an upcoming Nasa mission to return just 60g (two ounces) of material from an asteroid will cost about $1bn.

The MV-22 Osprey is a tilt-rotor aircraft, capable of carrying 24 people at a time in addition to four crew members. It is similar to a conventional plane, but has helicopter-like rotor blades which allow it to take off vertically, without a runway.
Australia's Daily Telegraph newspaper quoted military sources as saying that the accident happened as the aircraft was trying to land on the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier.
Australia's Defence Minister, Marise Payne, said she had spoken to her US counterpart, James Mattis, and confirmed the incident happened near Shoalwater Bay, off the coast of Queensland.
""I can confirm no Australian Defence Force personnel were on board the aircraft,"" she said in a statement.

867,"""Drive them out of this earth,"" he told regional leaders in Riyadh, as part of his first official trip abroad.
Mr Trump blamed Iran, Saudi Arabia's rival, for instability in the region.
His speech is seen as an attempted reset with Muslims after his harsh campaign rhetoric stirred concerns in the Islamic world.
Mr Trump had previously suggested he would be open to creating a database of all the Muslims in the US. And he had also called for Muslims to be temporarily banned from entering the US over security concerns.
But, speaking in the Saudi capital to leaders of 55 Muslim-majority countries, Mr Trump called this a ""new chapter"", saying he was not there to ""lecture"" them or impose the American way of life.
The fight against extremism, he added, was not a battle between different faiths or civilizations: ""This is a battle between good and evil"".
""A better future is only possible if your nations drive out the terrorists, and drive out the extremists"".
But, he added, the countries could not wait for ""American power"" to act, and had to ""fulfil their part of the burden"".
He singled out Iran for criticism, accusing it of fuelling sectarian conflict and supporting ""unspeakable crimes"" by the government of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria.
Behind the lavish praise heaped on his hosts, President Trump used this speech to deliver a tough message to Arab and Muslim governments: deal with the ideology that fuels terrorism now or live with it for generations to come.
He went out of his way to avoid the sort of inflammatory language he's more usually known for. His repeated condemnation of Saudi Arabia's regional rival Iran will have pleased the Gulf Arab leaders listening.
Unlike his predecessor, Barack Obama, this US president made no mention of human rights or democracy. But he did condemn the oppression of women.
And amongst several cynical reactions to the speech from around the region on social media, some have pointed out that here in Saudi Arabia women are forbidden to drive and there are no parliamentary elections. In Iran, the country accused by Mr Trump of being behind much of the current terrorism across the Middle East, they have just had a free election and women are free to drive.
Analysts said the speech was a change for Mr Trump, who is trying to redefine his relationship with the Muslim world after several controversial remarks, including an interview last year in which he famously said: ""I think Islam hates us.""
His highly anticipated address did not include the phrase ""radical Islamic terrorism"", which he had used before and is considered offensive by many Muslims. A transcript of the text published on his Facebook page included a mention of ""Islamist extremism"" and ""Islamist terror groups"".
But in his speech Mr Trump said: ""That means honestly confronting the crisis of Islamic extremism and the Islamists and Islamic terror of all kinds."" It was not immediately clear if he stumbled over the word or decided to change the script.
Meanwhile, the US and six Gulf states announced a deal to co-ordinate their efforts aimed at cutting off sources of money for extremist groups, including so-called Islamic State (IS).
The countries - Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain - are involved in the fight against the militants, but have been accused of backing the group and other Sunni militants - most notably in a 2014 email by Hillary Clinton released by Wikileaks.
""The unique piece of it is that every single one of them are signatories on how they're responsible and will actually prosecute the financing of terrorism, including individuals,"" said Dina Powell, US Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategy.

868,"Manchester United against Liverpool is a match which rarely fails to deliver some element of controversy. But the recent Steven Gerrard 38-second red card has nothing on the tie between the clubs 100 years ago.
On that day, there were ""two matches going on at once"" during a crucial bottom of the table clash at Old Trafford.
After an approach by a third party, some players from both sides hatched a plot to rig the game for a 2-0 home win, which eventually saw United avoid relegation.
""There was the realistic possibility of relegation for both of the sides - so it was an important match,"" says Graham Sharpe, a sports writer who has researched the fixture.
""It was overshadowed by the First World War, which had been raging for several months, and you could make the case that those players thought to themselves, 'when this season has finished, there may not be one to follow'.""
Many footballers had already signed up to fight, while others played on.
There were rumours about the honesty of the tie, even before kick-off.
There were eyewitness accounts of the two sets of players meeting up in Manchester pubs to discuss the outcome, before bets were placed at up to 8/1.
Bookmakers were naturally suspicious if they saw ""significant amounts of bets"" on one particular outcome or score, Mr Sharpe says.
A crowd of up to 18,000 witnessed one of the fixture's most extraordinary passages, when United were 1-0 up and won a penalty.
Patrick O'Connell, a centre half and the side's captain, stepped up and hit it so far wide it nearly hit the corner flag, according to match reports.
Mr Sharpe explains: ""From all reports, he walked back up the pitch laughing as he thought 'well it doesn't matter, we can get another goal whenever we want one'.""
There are accounts of a dressing room row at half-time, with some players who were not in on the plot threatening not to come out for the second half.
And after United got a second goal, the bet was nearly ruined when Liverpool forward Fred Pagnam hit the crossbar.
""A number of his teammates gestured angrily towards him,"" Mr Sharpe says.

But it was true, and the United States was rocked by the news that several members of the Chicago White Sox had conspired to fix the outcome of games against the Cincinnati Reds in return for $100,000 ($1.42m /Â£960k in today's money).

Failed floodlights scam 1997 - A businessman, with links to Chinese Triad gangs, was convicted of taking part in an Asian betting scam by plotting to black out a Charlton Athletic v Liverpool game.
Two previous matches - West Ham united v Crystal Palace and Wimbledon v Arsenal - saw the floodlights fail when the scores were level, a result favourable to a Far East betting syndicate.
""It's almost as if there were two matches going on at once.""
Suspicions were raised almost immediately after the game, with an inquiry announced shortly afterwards.
Later that year, Liverpool players Tom Fairfoul, Tom Miller, Bob Purcell and Jackie Sheldon and United's Enoch West, Sandy Turnbull and Arthur Whalley received lifetime bans.
Lawrence Cook, of Chester, and Manchester City's Fred Howard were also banned for their parts in the scam.
The Football Association said the players had ""sought to undermine the whole fabric of the game and discredit its honesty and fairness.""
Players were then called up to fight in the war.
When they returned, many had their bans lifted in recognition of their war efforts, while Turnbull received a posthumous pardon as he was fatally wounded at Arras in 1917.
However, Enoch 'Knocker' West, who had refused to admit his role in the plot and even sued the FA for libel, was not pardoned and remained banned from football for 30 years.
A recent campaign to clear his name has stalled because the FA said his documents were lost.
Alex Jackson, Collections Officer at the National Football Museum, thinks the player's motivations for the plot could be similar to that of the US baseball players involved in the 1919 Black Sox scandal.
He said footballer's wages had fallen after the outbreak of war and - similar to the Chicago White Sox players - financial reward was the aim.
Mr Sharpe believes it was ""a combination of 'let's stick two fingers up to authority' and 'let's cover ourselves in the event of losing our livelihoods or in fact our lives"".
Mr Jackson said: ""It was probably the biggest scandal of the time as it involved quite a number of players and two of the biggest clubs in the league.
""It is interesting that the players were approached by a third party to arrange the scam, but they were never found out"".
Mr Sharpe said the match changed the way the British betting industry operated.

Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, said the deal would bring ""welcome economic stability"" to fishing communities.
The Fish Council deal was also welcomed by the UK and Scottish governments.
Part of the agreement, struck in the early hours of Wednesday, will see cod and whiting come under the so-called discard ban for the first time.
That means skippers will be obliged to land catches of these fish even if they have gone over their quota allocation.
The new deal will see a 16.5% increase in the amount of cod that can be caught in the North Sea, while whiting catches could rise by 17%, anglerfish by 20% and 53% for saithe.
The SFF's Bertie Armstrong said: ""With Brexit now looming, fishermen can look to the future with real optimism as we are on the cusp of an exciting new era as a coastal state with full control of our 200-mile exclusive economic zone.
""This will give us the opportunity for fairer shares in catching opportunity and better fit-for-purpose sustainable fisheries management, which will benefit our coastal communities.""
Scottish Fisheries Secretary Fergus Ewing told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that the financial benefits of the new deal would be significant.
He said: ""The outcome is extremely positive and our recalculated estimates of the opportunities created from yesterday's agreement are Â£47m, but of course the fishermen have got to catch the fish.
""Translated into individual species, we were successful in obtaining increases for fish quotas for 16 out of 23 key Scottish stocks.""
Mr Ewing acknowledged there had been a 40% cut to haddock quotas for both the North Sea and waters west of Scotland.
However, he added: ""There was a cut in the quota to the North Sea, but it's slightly more complicated than that because last year there was an error and the quota was artificially inflated and there was a much smaller level of haddock actually caught.
""Therefore, in real terms, there is not such a cut, but overall these are extremely strong results for Scottish fisheries.""
The UK fisheries minister George Eustace said the agreement struck the right balance for the marine environment and our coastal communities.
He said: ""To deliver a profitable fishing industry, we must fish sustainably now and in the future. This year we were able to agree further increases in quotas on some valuable species as stocks have recovered, especially in the North Sea.
""As we prepare to leave the European Union we have an opportunity to build on progress made and improve the management of fish stocks in our waters, but we will continue to follow the principles of fishing sustainably and ending the wasteful practice of discarding fish.""","The EU fisheries ministers have approved increases for key fish species including cod and whiting.

I was staying in a small bed and breakfast run by a wonderful woman called Katherine and it didn't take long before I started feeling like I was part of the neighbourhood.
Of course, there was an international football tournament going on but people were also getting on with their regular lives.
There were school children running up the street getting ready for school, people getting their wares together to go to the market, people washing their taxi's and vehicles getting ready to go about their business.
Just being there and engaging with people was a remarkable experience. It's not just about their reaction to the fact that they are hosting a big football tournament but what is really going on in their lives.
I met some fascinating individuals. Almost everyone in South Africa has a story that starts in the past and moves into the present. There is so much history there, especially in Soweto, which still is very much the epicentre of South African politics.
It is the only place where you find Nelson Mandela's house up one street, and Desmond Tutu's house around the corner while just over the hill, that's where Winnie Mandela lives.
We were doing a broadcast one day out of a fast food restaurant and we noticed Desmond Tutu taking a walk. It doesn't happen anywhere else in the world.  Soweto is a fascinating place with wonderful people, I would go back in a minute.

881,"The UK general election, to choose all 650 members of Parliament, has produced a bit of a surprise result in which no-one is the clear winner.
Confused? Here's what you need to know.
The ruling Conservative Party (nicknamed the Tories) thought it was going to increase its numbers in Parliament, but has instead lost seats - and its slim majority; it held 330 seats before the election (326 is the magic number for a majority).
Instead, the opposition Labour Party has won back many seats.
To cap it all off, Prime Minister Theresa May didn't need to call this election - she did so because she thought she'd win a landslide. The result is being seen as a major defeat for her.
Remember that the UK is still a monarchy of sorts. There's lots of tradition involved.
This scenario is what Brits call a ""hung parliament"" - which just means that no party has a clear majority by itself.
Coalition or minority governments are fairly common in European countries like France, Germany, or close neighbour Ireland - but some in Britain tend to see them as unstable.
What happens next is that the largest party asks permission from the Queen to form a government. The monarch will never refuse this request - it's just a tradition in the constitutional monarchy that is the United Kingdom.
Theresa May visited the Queen just after noon, and the Conservatives are going to attempt to form a government relying on the backing of the Democratic Unionist Party from Northern Ireland.
If they can't, then Labour, the opposition, might try to put together a minority government. Or - always a possibility - there could be another election.
In the short term, this is a bit of a problem.
Negotiations for the UK leaving the EU are due to start on 20 June, just 11 days after the election. It's possible the UK won't even have a government in place by then.
Even if there is one, Theresa May's whole reason for calling the election was to stop ""political game-playing"" from other parties and give her the political clout to push through Brexit issues.
Instead, she has less power, and will need other parties to back her to even form a government at all.
The two largest parties both back Brexit, it's just a question of detail. The entire process is less stable now.
But, even if there is a delay in getting started, Brexit negotiations will happen - sooner or later.
By the morning rush hour, Theresa May was ""holed up inside"" her official residence, our political correspondent said, ""her political gamble having gone so badly wrong"".
Even before the last few results came in, chatter had already started about resignation - which is not uncommon in the UK.
Her main opponent, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, declared she had ""lost votes, lost support and lost confidence"", and: ""I would have thought that's enough to go, actually.""
Theresa May reportedly says she'll stay on, regardless. But talk of her future prospects is everywhere.
Jeremy is sometimes compared to US politician Bernie Sanders. He's an unusual party leader who has pulled off a personal victory here.
The lifelong socialist only put his name down for the Labour leadership because no other left-winger wanted to. Bookies gave him odds of 200/1 - but he won anyway, thanks to ordinary members' votes.
But the bicycle-riding, gardening, socialist leader didn't have the support of other Labour MPs - who almost immediately tried to push him out. He survived.
And while Labour technically lost this election, they made big gains over the 2015 vote. Anecdotal evidence suggests the youth vote turned out for Labour in a big way.
Owen Smith, who ran against Mr Corbyn for the leadership, said: ""I was clearly wrong in feeling Jeremy wouldn't be able to do this. He proved me wrong and lots of people wrong, and I take my hat off to him.""
An election could take place in a matter of weeks, but only if the negotiations break down and no-one can form any kind of government.
It might seem like there's a lot of politics right now, but that's because:
In theory, a government has a set five-year term, so the next election is due in 2022.
But - as we've seen - an unexpected election can be called at any time if enough MPs agree to it, or if the government collapses.
The Scottish National Party (SNP) had suggested the possibility of another referendum on Scottish independence, in the wake of the Brexit vote (Scotland mostly wanted to stay in the EU).
They entered the election campaign in a very dominant position, holding 56 of the 59 seats in Scotland - and were expected to lose some seats, which they did, to a Conservatives surge.
Deputy First Minister John Swinney admitted that the possibility of a second referendum on independence had played a ""significant"" role in the result.
Having lost 21 seats as a result, it's very unclear what happens next with the SNP's campaign for independence.
The UK doesn't have transfers or any kind of proportional representation, so it's quite hard for independents or small parties to succeed.
But - much to the delight of photographers - some candidates run for sheer spectacle, often in high-profile seats against party leaders or prime ministers.
This year's candidates included Lord Buckethead, real name unknown, Elmo (not, we believe, of Sesame Street), and Mr Fishfinger Man.
Oh, and the Monster Raving Loony party has been campaigning consistently since the 1980s.

883,"Scientists had wanted to engineer a variety with an odour that deterred aphids, nicknamed ""whiffy wheat"".
While it worked in the lab, out in the field, the wheat was still attacked by the pests.
But negative results are part-and-parcel of the scientific process; researchers behind the project will now work to improve the strain.
The wheat trial was the subject of protests by anti-GM campaigners in 2012. And opposition groups said the outcome was further evidence of the ""folly"" of investing in GM technology.
The research project itself cost £732,000; another £444,000 was spent on fencing to protect the trial site from intruders and to stop wild animals getting in.
The result of the trial held by Rothamsted Research in 2012-2013 was published this week in the journal Scientific Reports.
In the laboratory, the scientists were able for the first time to modify wheat so it produced a type of scent that aphids emit when they are threatened. It is a similar molecule to the one found in peppermint.
Aphids - such as greenfly and blackfly - damage plants by sucking nutrients from their sap, and can also introduce plant viruses.
In controlled conditions, the aphids were repelled and the predators were attracted.
This success did not transfer to the field. They are not quite sure why, but one hypothesis is that the aphids became used to the chemical deterrent, and so weren't put off by it.
Professor Huw Jones, senior molecular biologist at Rothamsted Research with oversight for the genetic changes in the plants said: ""As scientists we are trained to treat our experimental data objectively and dispassionately but I was definitely disappointed.
""We had hoped that this technique would offer a way to reduce the use of insecticides in pest control in arable farming. As so often happens, this experiment shows that the real world environment is much more complicated than the laboratory.""
However, the scientists point out that some failures are inevitable. Dr Toby Bruce, first author of the study and senior chemical ecologist at Rothamsted Research commented: ""In science we never expect to get confirmation of every hypothesis.
""Often it is the negative results and unexpected surprises that end up making big advances - penicillin was discovered by accident, for example.
""If we knew the answers to every question before we started, there would be no need for science and there would be no innovation.
""This trial has ended up yielding more questions than answers, but that means we have more work to do to understand the insect-plant interaction and to better mimic what happens in nature.""
Campaign group GM Freeze, the UK's umbrella campaign on GM food and farming, said that the outcome of the trials provides clear evidence of the ""folly"" of focusing public resources on the development and promotion of GM crops.
Liz O'Neill, director of GM Freeze, said: ""The waste of over £1m of public funding on a trial confirms the simple fact that when GM tries to outwit nature, nature adapts in response.""
Lincolnshire Farmer Peter Lundgren was a vocal opponent at the time of the trials. He responded by saying: ""The truth is that nature is just too complex for the simplistic thinking behind GM.
""Meanwhile, we are crying out for investment in proven solutions like integrated pest management, companion cropping, conventional plant breeding, and novel chemistry.
""It's time to stop throwing good money after bad and put our publicly funded scientists to work on solutions that will give growers effective and financially viable options to control pests and the diseases they carry.""
But many scientists argue that the technology has the potential to help solve looming problems with the world's food supply, by - for example - increasing yields to make more efficient use of land, and lowering the quantities of pesticides used on crops.
Prof Jonathan Jones, a molecular biologist at The Sainsbury Laboratory in Norwich, said: ""These data provide a timely reminder that what works in the lab might not always work in the field, especially when the GM trait is intended to influence something as complex as insect behaviour.
""Despite the strenuous efforts of anti-GM protestors, a field experiment was conducted, a clear result was obtained, and the scientists involved can now use this information to refine and improve their technical approaches to control aphids in crops without using insecticides.""
The Rothamsted Research study was funded by Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), which is in turn funded by the government.
The author and campaigner Tony Juniper told the BBC: ""I still believe the industry is finding it hard to prove a role for itself and that conversations going on around more integrated approaches to farming - that rely less on technological 'silver bullets' - have more potential than the pursuit of GM methods, that often miss the point as to what the actual problem is.
""Then there are the issues about who controls the technology, via patents, contracts and royalty payments, and how the widespread uptake of GM farming could have profound impacts in terms of how power is distributed across the food system.""

But speaking on a visit to the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, he said handing the money back was not ""the right approach"" because Mrs Chernukhin had ""lived in Britain for many years"" and was now a British citizen.
Mr Cameron has criticised France for going through with a deal to sell warships to the country despite Moscow's backing for separatists in Ukraine.
But France's Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius hit back on Monday, suggesting Britain should look at the number of Russian oligarchs in London before criticising his country.
Downing Street rejected the charge of hypocrisy, saying there had been no criticism of Mr Cameron from ""around the EU table"".
""The PM and other EU leaders are entirely focused on what should be done following the terrible loss of life rather than raising other issues,"" said a source.
A tennis match with the prime minister and Boris Johnson was the star lot at a Tory fundraising ball held in London earlier this month, which reportedly raised £500,000 for the party's general election war chest.
A Tory spokesman said the gift from Mrs Chernukhin, a longstanding Conservative donor, would not be paid back because it was within the rules and would be declared to the Electoral Commission.
Her husband Vladimir, who was a Russian finance minister, was sacked in 2004 and had fallen out with President Putin and did not have links with the Putin regime, added the spokesman, and the couple were now both British citizens.
The spokesman said he was confident all gifts from donors with Russian links were in order and complied with the rules.
Asked by Sky News about whether he would take part in the game, Boris Johnson said: ""I think we've got to do something that actually hits Putin and his government where it hurts and make a real difference to their attitude.
""I know about this tennis match, they volunteered me to play tennis with some geezer and it's very, very important that full checks are carried out to ensure this is not someone who is an intimate of Putin or a crony and we are doing that at the moment.""
He later issued a statement, saying: ""We need to exert maximum pressure on Putin to do the right thing in Ukraine by targeting him and his cronies.
""I'm assured by the government that Mr Chernukhin doesn't fall into that category.
""It's important that we don't lash out with measures that would simply attack all Russians everywhere.""
Labour MP Chris Bryant called on the Conservatives to pay the money back, telling The Guardian: ""President Putin will just laugh at David Cameron if he is taking £160,000 from one of his old mates while trying to pretend he is being robust on Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and almost certain criminal involvement in the bringing down of MH17.
""Since 2010 Cameron has repeatedly misread Russia. He has wanted just to do business with Russians and take Russian money but there's a black heart at the centre of the present regime. The Tories should give the money back. He can't possibly be seen to play this game of tennis.""
A number of wealthy, UK-based Russians have donated money to the Conservative Party in recent years.
At the same fundraising dinner, Ukrainian-born energy magnate Alexander Temerko, a political opponent of Putin who successfully fought extradition proceedings to remain in Britain,  is reported to have paid £90,000 for a bronze bust of Mr Cameron, which he donated to the Carlton Club.
Mr Temerko, a former senior executive at Russian oil giant Yukos, who is now a British citizen, has made donations of more than £280,000 to central Tory funds or MPs in the past two years, according to The Electoral Commission.
Labour MP John Healey has written to the PM demanding to know what background checks he has overseen on Russians who have donated to the Conservatives during his tenure as party leader, and whether Russian donors have been able to meet ministers to discuss politics.
It comes as an influential committee of MPs said UK licences to export arms worth millions of pounds to Russia remained in place despite fears Moscow is arming rebels in Ukraine.","David Cameron has defended accepting a donation from a Russian businesswoman who bid for a tennis match with him and London mayor Boris Johnson at a fundraising event.

Mr Galan was shot dead on 18 August 1989 as he walked onto a stage to address a crowd in the town of Soacha.
Prosecutors accuse Gen Maza of conspiring with a drugs cartel to murder Mr Galan, which he denies.
The murder of Mr Galan in front of thousands of people rocked Colombia.
The liberal politician campaigned on an anti-corruption platform and was a favourite to win the 1990 election.
Mr Galan made powerful enemies when he said that if elected he would have drug traffickers extradited to the United States.
Colombian drug traffickers, who often enjoyed special, sometimes luxurious treatment in Colombian jails, feared extradition to US jails.
Mr Galan had received a number of death threats against himself and his family in the run-up to his murder.
Prosecutors allege Gen Maza played a role in Mr Galan's killing by reducing his security detail and replacing his experienced chief of security with someone relatively new to the task.
They say he also collaborated with the Medellin drug cartel and its leader Pablo Escobar to infiltrate Mr Galan's security team.
His trial is set to start on Monday.
Gen Maza told Colombian weekly Semana that he himself had been the target of five assassination attempts by drug cartels, including a massive car bomb which killed dozens of people outside the DAS headquarters in December 1989.
He said accusations that he had collaborated with the Medellin cartel were therefore ""ludicrous"".
One of those expected to give evidence as part of Gen Maza's trial is Pablo Escobar's top hit man John Jairo Velasquez, also known as Popeye.
He told Semana that Gen Maza and Pablo Escobar were ""arch-enemies"".
After Mr Galan's murder, a key member of his campaign team, Cesar Gaviria, replaced him as the liberal candidate and was elected president in 1990.
A 1991 constitutional amendment prohibited Colombian nationals from being extradited to the US.
The day after the amendment was passed, Pablo Escobar handed himself in with the proviso that he would be jailed in a prison he himself had built.
He later escaped from the prison and was shot dead in 1993 while on the run from the authorities.

The Awate.com news website, which is hosted in the United States and serves an Eritrean audience, did comment on the incident, saying that ''the only way to stop such tragedies from repeating over and over again is to target the root cause - the predatory Eritrean regime'', which it said Eritrean migrants were escaping from. ã€€
In Italy, the main papers all carried pictures of body bags, survivors and rescuers.

National daily Corriere Della Sera carried a front-page commentary by Gian Antonio Stella saying that a long-running tally of the death toll for illegal immigrants trying to get to Europe was now said to be around 20,000.
""These waves of people coming ashore cannot remain an Italian problem. This issue concerns everyone. Just as the mayor of Lampedusa urged [prime minister Enrico] Letta to ""come and count the dead with us""... so should the same cry be directed at Brussels,"" he wrote.
Rome's La Repubblica published an interview with Integration Minister Cecile Kyenge, who is Congolese-born and the first black minister to serve in Italy's cabinet.
She told the paper that ""I could have been on that boat"" and that it was time to review Italy's 2002 immigration law, which introduced criminal sanctions for those caught entering the country illegally.
Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano on its front page echoed the words of Pope Francis, who described the disaster as ""a disgrace which must not be repeated"".
In Germany, Christian Jakob said in Berlin's Die Tageszeitung: ''In the face of the catastrophe everyone is blaming unprincipled people smugglers, or is even demanding 'national mourning'. But it's clear what must be done... Europe must open itself up again to those seeking shelter. Otherwise the dying will continue.''
Klaus Huhold in Austria's Wiener Zeitung said: ''Europe's present immigration policy tries to make it as hard as possible for refugees to get to Europe in the first place... The tragedy of Lampedusa proves again how ineffective this policy is and the deadly consequences it can bring. Whoever sees a journey on a wooden boat to Lampedusa as his last chance will take that chance - no matter how dangerous it might be.''
In Switzerland's TagesAnzeiger, Stephan Israel said: ""Countries without external borders - such as Germany or Switzerland - can no longer leave it to the exposed Italians, Spanish or Greeks to deal with the refugee trek. Some more solidarity would make the horror at the daily drama on the margins of affluence more credible.''
Spain's El Pais reported on the sinking and said: ""The only thing that is different is the number. A number sufficiently high to be dressed up with big words of mourning and alarm; an endless line of dead without names at the start of the TV news. The rest happens every day.''
Somali websites carried factual reports on the sinking: ""More than 130 Africans including Somalis died in Lampedusa"" (Shabeelle); ""Boat carrying 500 immigrants sinks in Italian shore"" (Dayniile); ""Three-hundred African immigrants killed in Italy's Lampedusa sinking"" (Jowhar) and ""Death toll in Lampedusa sinking reaches 300"" (Midnimo).

892,"""The quake zone urgently needs tents, quilt, instant food, drinking water and medical goods,"" the charity posted to Weibo, China's version of Twitter. ""Please try your best to donate cash.""
In response, hundreds of thousands of people quickly posted emoticons giving the government-run charity a literal thumbs-down.
""People around me are all hesitating whether to donate to the earthquake zone,"" wrote online user Li Yapingww. ""They don't know if their hard-earned money can reach the victims.""
Another user, named ""Lao Xu"", was enraged by a photo of Chinese Red Cross employees in the quake zone. ""They're eating instant noodles while wearing expensive watches. These photos are just asking for criticism.""
Designer watches are at the tip of the charity organisation's image problem: the organisation has yet to recover from a series of scandals that began after the Sichuan earthquake in 2008.
Back then, the Chinese Red Cross was designated as one of two charities that could legally accept donations. Smaller organisations were told to funnel their donations to their larger counterparts.
According to China's state-run media, over $12.4 bn US dollars (£8.1 bn) in goods and services were donated to quake victims in the year after the 2008 Sichuan quake.
However, the charity's reputation was soon tarnished.  Some monitoring the quake's rebuilding efforts accused Red Cross officials of misusing donations by purchasing needlessly expensive tents and vehicles, though those allegations were denied.
In 2009, researchers at Tsinghua University revealed that 80% of charitable donations after 2008's Sichuan earthquake were funnelled into Chinese government coffers as ""extra revenue"".
At the time, some contended this was appropriate, since the government was best equipped to rebuild the quake zone.
Others complained the Red Cross donations would be impossible to track, leading to fears of corruption.
In April 2011, revelations of an extravagant banquet attended by Red Cross officials costing almost 10,000 yuan ($1,600; £1,050) spurred criticism online. The amount is considered high within China, especially for employees of a charity. Officials apologised and offered to foot part of the bill themselves.
Months later, the organisation was decimated by a much bigger scandal when a glamorous young woman calling herself ""Guo Meimei"" posted online photos of herself posing with luxury cars and designer handbags.
Ms Guo boasted that she was the ""general manager"" of the China Red Cross Commerce Department - a commercial organisation with murky links to the charity.
It turned out that Ms Guo had inflated her own title, but the damage had already been done: many donors had scrutinised the photos of Guo's extravagant lifestyle and had concluded that the Red Cross was wasting their money.
That year, the charity registered a 60% drop in private donations.
""At the moment, many Chinese people are hostile to government officials and rich people,"" explains Jia Xijin, deputy professor of public management at Tsinghua University.
""So now, they've also started to question government-sponsored institutions.""
The Chinese Red Cross has been trying to reform its image. Last December, the Chinese Red Cross formed a 16-member committee to improve its transparency.
Most concerned citizens don't have any other choice but to trust the Chinese Red Cross with their earthquake donations, since once again, the charity is one of the only organisations that can receive money for victims of the current crisis.
""I don't believe in the Red Cross, but I choose to believe those who participate in the rescue work on the front line. They need to be respected,"" rationalises Weibo user Juan er.
""Those who are corrupt are the top officials and those who suffer are the people at the bottom. Blindly cursing at people won't prove how moral you are.""","The Chinese Red Cross is facing criticism and hesitation from the public regarding donations for the earthquake zone.

895,"Chemicals present in beer's hops break down over time, forming other compounds that result in the unpleasant taste.
Researchers reporting in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry say the trick to avoiding the taste is to avoid that breakdown.
That can be done by adjusting beers' acidity when it is produced, and by always keeping it cool.
The idea that the naturally-present, slightly bitter-tasting compounds are the source of the more bitter, more long-lasting flavours of ""aged"" beer is not new.
But the exact catalogue of compounds that are responsible and how they develop over time has remained a mystery until now.
Researchers at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) have been looking into the particulars of beer chemistry for a number of years.
For the recent study, they stored a number of commercially available, pilsner-style beers for as much as 10 years in order to compare the chemistry of aged beers with that of freshly-obtained samples.
The primary offenders are what are known as trans-iso-alpha acids, which over time degrade into a number of chemicals that lead to bad taste - and it is these that the TUM researchers hope to address.
Recent studies have shown that the level of acidity, or pH, has a strong effect on the degradation of trans-iso-alpha acids, but the new study indicated that pH in ageing beer was incredibly stable - so the researchers asked a commercial brewer to make batches of beer with slightly varying pH levels.
They found that by making beer that was incrementally less acidic, the trans-iso-alpha acid degradation process could be much reduced.
However, the reactions that transform the acids into the ingredients of a stale-tasting beer are accelerated at higher temperatures, so the simplest route to keeping beer tasting fresh is to keep it cool.","Researchers have discovered that the naturally-present compounds in beer's hops break down over time, forming other compounds that result in an unpleasant taste.

It said the government had made progress in the past year in managing the Common Agricultural Policy fines.
But it warned the amount of fines levied was likely to rise because the policy had been made more complex.
The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which supports the agricultural sector with subsidies, is the most expensive scheme in the EU, accounting for about 38% of its budget.
The money is spent on direct payments to farmers and rural development programmes.
The European Commission can impose fines where it does not think member states have complied with its guidelines.
The NAO said that of every £100 received from Brussels through the policy, £2.70 was given back in fines, with late payments to farmers and poor mapping data among the reasons.
Despite attempts to make the scheme more simple, the NAO said the updated policy had become more complex - with the government warning it will be 15% more expensive to manage than the old version.
Meg Hillier, the chairwoman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, which oversees the work of the NAO, said the prospect of further fines was ""frightening"".

Those who spoke very fast, did not pause or were too animated were least successful.
A UK language expert said it showed ""it's not about what you say, but how you say it"".
The University of Michigan Institute of Social Research study used recordings of introductory calls made by 100 male and female telephone interviewers at the institute.
They looked at the interviewers' speech rates, fluency, and pitch, and then at how successful they were in convincing people to participate in the survey.
Those who spoke at a rate of around 3.5 words per second (moderately fast) were much more successful at convincing people to take part than those who spoke very fast or very slowly.

The study, funded by the US National Science Foundation and presented to the American Association for Public Opinion Research, also found people thought too much variation in pitch ""sounds artificial"" and ""like people are trying too hard"".

Investigation work starts on 26 June for up to four weeks meaning it will be shut to vehicles from 3 July on weekdays for a fortnight.
When it was officially opened nearly 200 years ago, the structure was the longest wrought iron suspension bridge in the world.
However, it has become structurally unsafe and can now only be accessed by one light vehicle at a time.
Northumberland County Council (NCC), Scottish Borders Council (SBC) and the Friends of Union Chain Bridge  are working together on the project to safeguard the future of the bridge near Berwick-upon-Tweed.
It requires urgent conservation and engineering repairs to secure its future.
A funding bid for the restoration is now being prepared for the Heritage Lottery Fund, with a maximum of £5m available towards the bulk of the work.

Other stakeholders are also expected to make ""significant contributions"".
The investigation work hopes to provide a greater understanding of the status and condition of the bridge - allowing a ""more robust bid"" to be submitted to the HLF.
Diversions will be in place for traffic on weekdays while the bridge will be open to pedestrians and cyclists at all times and to vehicles at weekends.

The member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill followed in the footsteps of Labour legend Keir Hardie by wearing his old work shirt on his first trip to the Commons.
Spying the ParcelForce logo on the former postie's shirt, someone apparently asked Mr Gaffney what he was supposed to be delivering: ""justice for workers"" came the prompt reply.
Elsewhere, Lesley Laird had a pretty good week as the new Labour MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath.
Not only did she recapture Gordon Brown's old seat in Fife, once the safest of safe Labour heartlands, but she was appointed Jeremy Corbyn's new shadow Scottish secretary.
Two Conservative MSPs-turned-MPs handled the change of scenery by carrying on some of their old habits in a new setting.
Douglas Ross and John Lamont used to go running together in Edinburgh - now they do it in London.
The move to Westminster didn't stop their old Holyrood colleagues poking some fun; Edward Mountain claimed Olympic athlete turned Tory MSP Brian Whittle was ""delighted the slow runners have moved to London"".
Moray MP Mr Ross said life at Westminster was ""very different"" to the more modern parliament at Holyrood, with ""very peculiar ways of doing things"".
David Linden is one new MP who probably won't need to be shown where the canteen is. The SNP member for Glasgow East previously worked for Glasgow Central MP Alison Thewliss.
Not only do they now represent neighbouring constituencies, they have been allocated neighbouring coat pegs - complete with pink ribbons to hang their swords on.
He described the first meeting of parliament as ""more pantomime than anything"", and said there was a strange ""us and them mentality"" with some areas for MPs only. ""There are some toilets I was never allowed in before because I was a staffer not an MP,"" he said.
To reinforce the ""first day at school"" feeling, Mr Linden was sworn in wearing his old Bannerman High School tie, and revealed that his mum had even bought him a new pencil case for his first day.
New Lib Dem MP Christine Jardine is another who has spent time at Westminster, as an advisor to the coalition government.
However, the Edinburgh West representative professed to being nervous ahead of her swearing-in, and said it was still easy to get lost now she is allowed in members-only areas.
It has also been a turbulent start to the new parliament for the Lib Dems, with leader Tim Farron resigning - and Dunbartonshire East MP Jo Swinson tipped as a potential successor.
Ms Jardine said being an MP was a ""huge privilege"".
She said: ""It's quite overpowering sometimes when you think about the people who have gone before you - it's a lot to live up to. But you have to not let yourself be drawn in too much - the day job is back in the constituency, it's the constituents and their issues that matter and come first.""","The new Scottish MPs have been settling into their roles at Westminster. Among them, Hugh Gaffney, the new Labour MP for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill, made a striking debut by wearing his old work shirt on his first trip to the Commons.

902,"It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in a same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.
A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 52% to 48%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.
Get the results in full.
England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%, as did Wales, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.
Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who resigned on the day after losing the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she says she will respect the will of the people. She has said ""Brexit means Brexit"" but there is still a lot of debate about what that will mean in practice especially on the two key issues of how British firms do business in the European Union and what curbs are brought in on the rights of European Union nationals to live and work in the UK. She set out more details of her negotiating hopes in her key speech on Brexit.
The UK economy appears to have weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote, although the value of the pound remains near a 30-year low, but opinion is sharply divided over the long-term effects of leaving the EU. Some major firms such as Easyjet and John Lewis have pointed out that the slump in sterling has increased their costs. Britain also lost its top AAA credit rating, meaning the cost of government borrowing will be higher. But share prices have recovered from a dramatic slump in value, with both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250 index, which includes more British-based businesses, trading higher than before the referendum. The Bank of England cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - a record low and the first cut since 2009 - after the vote and there has not been the economic slump or recession that some had predicted. Here is a regularly updated detailed rundown of how Britain's economy is doing
The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other.
It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.
For the UK to leave the EU it has to invoke an agreement called Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May has said she intends to trigger this process by the end of March 2017, meaning the UK will be expected to have left by the summer of 2019, depending on the precise timetable agreed during the negotiations. The government will also enact a Great Repeal Bill which will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. It is expected to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove.
After a court battle, the UK's Supreme Court has ruled that Parliament must be consulted before Article 50 is invoked.
This means legislation will be prepared for MPs and Lords to vote on. The verdict was not what the government argued for, but ministers have insisted it will not delay their planned timetable.
Most MPs are expected to vote in favour of Article 50 being triggered, although there could be attempts to amend the draft legislation.
Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These men - dubbed the Three Brexiteers - will play a central role in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although it will be Mrs May, as prime minister, who will have the final say. The government did not do any emergency planning for Brexit ahead of the referendum and Mrs May has rejected calls to say what her negotiating goals are.
Once Article 50 has been triggered, the UK will have two years to negotiate its withdrawal. But no one really knows how the Brexit process will work - Article 50 was only created in late 2009 and it has never been used. Former Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, now Chancellor, wanted Britain to remain in the EU, and he has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete exit negotiations. The terms of Britain's exit will have to be agreed by 27 national parliaments, a process which could take some years, he has argued.
EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. The UK will continue to abide by EU treaties and laws, but not take part in any decision-making.
Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.
Following Theresa May's Brexit recent speech we now know that the UK is not intending to stay in the EU's single market. Although there has been speculation for months about the issue, it would have meant the UK staying under the auspices of the European Court of Justice and having to allow unlimited EU immigration, under freedom of movement rules.
Both sides want trade to continue after Brexit with the UK seeking a positive outcome for those who wish to trade goods and services"" - such as those in the City of London and wanting a ""comprehensive free trade deal"" giving the UK ""the greatest possible access"" to the single market. Mrs May says she wants the UK to reach a new customs union deal with the EU. A customs union is where countries agree not to impose tariffs on each others' goods and have a common tariff on goods coming in from elsewhere. The UK is currently part of the EU customs union but that stops the UK being able to do its own trade deals with other countries. Reality Check: How could customs union work?
These terms have increasingly been used as debate focused on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.
So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people in order to maintain access to the EU single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result.
The government has declined to give a firm guarantee about the status of EU nationals currently living in the UK, saying this is not possible without a reciprocal pledge from other EU members about the millions of British nationals living on the continent. EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, will be be able to stay, the chief civil servant at the Home Office has said. The rights of other EU nationals would be subject to negotiations on Brexit and the ""will of Parliament"", he added.
A lot depends on the kind of deal the UK agrees with the EU. If it remains within the single market, it would almost certainly retain free movement rights, allowing UK citizens to work in the EU and vice versa. If the government opted to impose work permit restrictions, then other countries could reciprocate, meaning Britons would have to apply for visas to work.
Again, it depends on whether the UK government decides to introduce a work permit system of the kind that currently applies to non-EU citizens, limiting entry to skilled workers in professions where there are shortages. Citizens' Advice has reminded people their rights have not changed yet and asked anyone to contact them if they think they have been discriminated against following the Leave vote.
Brexit Secretary David Davis has suggested EU migrants who come to the UK as Brexit nears may not be given the right to stay. He has said there might have to be a cut-off point if there was a ""surge"" in new arrivals.
People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote.
The day-to-day spending impact is likely to be more significant. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it to remain at least 10% below where it was on 23 June, in the long term.
This means imported goods will consequently get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have already been seen and the issue was most notably illustrated by the dispute between Tesco and Marmite's makers about whether prices would be put up or not in the stores.
The latest UK inflation figures, for December, showed the CPI inflation rate jumping to 1.6%, its highest level for two years with signs of more cost pressures set to feed through in the months to come.
Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration.
She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations. As mentioned above, the key issue is whether other EU nations will grant the UK access to the single market, if that is what it wants, while at the same time being allowed to restrict the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK.
Mrs May has said she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. It is currently running at 330,000 a year, of which 184,000 are EU citizens, and 188,000 are from outside the EU - the figures include a 39,000 outflow of UK citizens.
It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Liberal Democrats - who have just a handful of MPs - have vowed to halt Brexit and keep Britain in the EU if they were to win the next general election.
Some commentators, including former House of Commons clerk Lord Lisvane, have argued that a further referendum would be needed to ratify whatever deal the UK hammers out with the EU, but there are few signs political leaders view this as a viable option.
Yes. Theresa May has appeared keen to avoid a vote on her negotiating stance, to avoid having to give away her priorities, but Theresa May has said there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. It is worth mentioning that any deal also has to be agreed by the European Parliament - with British MEPs getting a chance to vote on it there.
While there could be limitations on British nationals' ability to live and work in EU countries, it seems unlikely they would want to deter tourists. There are many countries outside the European Economic Area, which includes the 28 EU nations plus Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway, that British citizens can visit for up to 90 days without needing a visa and it is possible that such arrangements could be negotiated with European countries.
Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. In theory, the government could, if it wanted, decide to change the colour, which is currently standardised for EU countries, says the BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris.
The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place.
Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.
The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country.
It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"".
Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.  Read more: A free trade area v EU single market
No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland at the end of last year to find out how they did it.
Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it is ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faces being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. A second independence referendum for the country is now ""highly likely"", she has said, although not in 2017. She has said she wants Scotland to stay in the single market and said Mrs May's decision to rule out the UK staying in the single market ""undoubtedly"" brings the referendum closer.
Before his resignation Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said the impact in Northern Ireland would be ""very profound"" and that the whole island of Ireland should now be able to vote on reunification. But, speaking while she was still Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers ruled out the call from Sinn Féin for a border poll, saying the circumstances in which one would be called did not exist. The land border is likely to be a key part of the Brexit talks. Theresa May said a priority for her would be negotiating a deal with the EU which allowed a common travel area between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.
During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. But his successor Theresa May has said she will keep it in place, at least for the current Parliament, which is due to last until 2020.
So far there has been a cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. There are yet to be signs that rising inflation have worried the Bank of England  enough to consider raising interest rates.  But if that happened it would make mortgages and loans more expensive to repay - but would be good news for savers.
Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.
Eurotunnel boss Jacques Gounon said last November the reintroduction of duty-free would be ""an incredible boost for my business"" but he later said  that remark had been ""light-hearted"". Erik Juul-Mortensen, president of the Tax Free World Association (TFWA) said after the referendum vote ""it is not possible to predict how Brexit will affect the duty free and travel retail industry, and it is wiser not to make assumptions about exactly what the impact will be.""
They are at the moment but no-one knows the longer term prospects for definite. The EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - is not an EU initiative. It was negotiated between countries within a group known as the European Economic Area, often simply referred to as the single market (plus Switzerland, which confusingly is not a member of the EEA, but has agreed access to the single market). Therefore, the future of Britons' EHIC cover could depend on whether the UK decided to sever ties with the EEA.
Probably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.
Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act.
The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report. In practice, Conservative MPs who voted to remain in the EU would be whipped to vote with the government. Any who defied the whip would have to face the wrath of voters at the next general election.
One scenario that could see the referendum result overturned, is if MPs forced a general election and a party campaigned on a promise to keep Britain in the EU, got elected and then claimed that the election mandate topped the referendum one. Two-thirds of MPs would have to vote for a general election to be held before the next scheduled one in 2020.
The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution.
It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.
However, the UK government is committed to repealing the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights.
As part of that, the UK government is expected to announce measures that will boost the powers of courts in England and Wales to over-rule judgements handed down by the ECHR.
However, the EU has its own European Court of Justice, whose decisions are binding on EU institutions and member states.
Its rulings have sometimes caused controversy in Britain and supporters of a Brexit have called for immediate legislation to curb its powers.
BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.
The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in May's general election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving.
They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also cited sovereignty and democracy, and they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work.
One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"".
Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in.
He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.
Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in.
US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did other EU nations such as France and Germany.
Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it gets a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services.
They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.
Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world.
Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Four of the biggest US banks have committed to helping maintain the City's position. But HSBC will move up to 1,000 jobs to Paris, the BBC understands.
Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Pest control firm Rentokil Initial says it could make £15m extra this year thanks to a weaker currency.
Others are less optimistic. Hilary Jones, a director at UK cosmetics firm Lush said the company was ""terrified"" about the economic impact. She added that while the firm's Dorset factory would continue to produce goods for the UK market, products for the European market may be made at its new plant in Germany.
Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.
Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.
Thanks for sending in your questions. Here are a selection of them, and our answers:
The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.
In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out, only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.
The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10.
The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.
David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. This is one of those issues where it is not possible to say definitively what would happen. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. Similar arrangements are in place with other EU countries.
If Britain remains in the single market, or the European Economic Area as it is known, it might be able to continue with this arrangement, according to a House of Commons library research note. If Britain has to negotiate trade deals with individual member states, it may opt to continue paying for expats' healthcare through the NHS or decide that they would have to cover their own costs if they continue to live abroad, if the country where they live declines to do so.
Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU. The answer is that they would remain in place, initially at least. After the Leave vote, the government will probably review all EU-derived laws in the two years leading up to the official exit date to see which ones to keep or scrap.
The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.
The government would want to avoid a legislative vacuum caused by the repeal of EU laws before new UK laws are in place - it would also continue to abide by other international agreements covering environmental protection.
Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m.
But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.
Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""
As with most elements of the UK economy, not enough solid data has been published yet to accurately conclude the Brexit effect on house prices. Industry figures have pointed to ""uncertainty"" among buyers and sellers that could potentially change the housing market.
So far, the most significant research has come from the respected Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has published the conclusions of a survey of its members. This primarily records sentiment among surveyors.
It found that house prices are expected to fall across the UK in the three months after the referendum vote. However, the dip in prices is only expected to persist over the 12 months from June in London and East Anglia, surveyors predict.
House prices were already slowing in central London, owing to the fall-out from changes to stamp duty rules in April.
Separate figures from property portal Rightmove suggested the average asking price of houses coming on to the market in England and Wales fell by 0.9%, or £2,647, in July compared with June. It said that agents had reported very few sales had fallen through as a result of the vote.
Many potential first-time buyers would welcome a fall in house prices, with ownership among the young falling owing to affordability concerns. Investors in property, or those who have paid off a mortgage and hope to leave homes as inheritance would be unhappy with a long-term reduction in value.
Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.
There is nothing to stop a future UK government reproducing these regulations in British law following the decision to leave the EU. And the costs of so-called ""red tape"" will not necessarily disappear overnight - if Britain opted to follow the ""Norway model"" and remained in the European Economic Area most of the EU-derived laws would remain in place.
Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States will create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.
Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believe it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year.
But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights.
Quitting the EU means the UK will not be part of TTIP. It will have negotiate its own trade deal with the US.
Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS.
This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claims is £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.
Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.

Hamilton won his third championship with victory at Sunday's US Grand Prix to draw level with racing greats Sir Jackie Stewart and Ayrton Senna.
Mansell believes that fellow Briton Hamilton, 30, is ""untouchable"".
""Lewis is hot favourite for the 2016 and even the 2017 championship,"" Mansell told BBC Radio 5 live.
German driver Schumacher's record title haul included five back-to-back titles between 2000 and 2004.
Mansell believes the reliability of the Mercedes car is key to Hamilton emulating Schumacher.
Only once this season, in Singapore, has Hamilton been forced to retire from a race.
Mansell added: ""In the present day, no one can touch Lewis. He deserves every accolade. There will be jealousy that he is in the best team.
""It is the start of even bigger and better things to come. I would say [to Hamilton]: Focus on Michael Schumacher's record.
""There is no reason why he cannot win more back-to-back titles. Schumacher has the most reliable car in F1 history, he won three world championships on reliability alone.""

904,"However, there have been signs that IS and its supporters would not shy away from their use.
A month ago, online supporters of the group boasted of an attack against Kurdish forces near the Tigris river in northern Iraq, saying they had used an unspecified chemical weapon.
They said 40 mortar rounds had been used to deliver the weapons targeting Kurdish Peshmerga fighters in the village of Tall Rim on 11 August.
The next day, IS officially acknowledged firing mortars in the area and published photographs showing the rounds being fired, apparently illustrating the same attack, but it did not mention chemical weapons.
Separately, German officials said they suspected that IS had used mustard gas against Kurdish forces in that area south-west of Irbil, at about that time.
While talk of non-conventional weapons is not currently a burning issue among IS supporters, there has been a long history of debate on the subject in jihadist circles going back more than a decade.
Many have argued in favour of their use, comparing them to weapons like catapults used in early Islamic times. But others have objected, saying Islam does not permit such indiscriminate killing.
IS itself has a track record of flouting international conventions and may have recently found a new ally to help it justify the use of weapons like mustard gas.
Last month, IS supporters online celebrated what they said was a pledge of allegiance to IS leader Abu-Bakr al-Baghdadi from radical Saudi cleric Nasir al-Fahd.
Mr Fahd is the highest profile figure to sanction the use of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in jihad, publishing a fatwa on the subject in May 2003.
Mr Fahd's fatwa appears to sanction the use of a nuclear weapon against the US as a form of retaliation for Muslim deaths.
""If a bomb were dropped on them killing ten million [Americans] and burning as much of their land as they have burned Muslims' land, it would be permissible, without the need to mention any other evidence,"" he wrote.
""But we might need other evidence if we wanted to wipe out more than that number of them.""
The fatwa also quotes extensively from Islamic texts to argue that jihadists can use WMD if they judge that is the only way to ""repel the infidels"".
He was arrested the same month and remains in prison to this day.
On 24 August, a pro-IS media group circulated what were said to be handwritten messages from Mr Fahd, smuggled out of prison, announcing his loyalty to IS and encouraging others to fight under its banner.
Given Nasir al-Fahd's standing in jihadist circles, if the notes are genuine, his backing for IS would boost the group's claim to religious legitimacy.
It would also help it justify any use of chemical or other non-conventional weapons, given his high-profile endorsement of WMD use by jihadists.

Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy pulled out of the England squad with a ""minor injury"" picked up in training.
Tottenham forward Harry Kane will captain England for the first time.
Scotland, fourth in the six-team Group F, are six points behind unbeaten leaders England with five games remaining.
McGhee said earlier this week that they have not given up hope of topping the group, but to do so they must end a run of three defeats against England.
Strachan's side, who have won two of their opening five games, are more realistically hoping to be one of the runners-up who will go into the qualification play-offs.
However, the head coach believes his side are capable of ending the Three Lions' long run without losing a qualification fixture.
Strachan is almost certain to continue with one striker, with the choice likely to be between Griffiths, who started November's 3-0 defeat at Wembley, or Derby County's Chris Martin, who scored in the 1-0 win over Slovenia in March.
""People say he's only playing one striker, but sometimes you play with three and two of them are wide,"" stressed Strachan.

""We didn't expect it to go to number one on iTunes. That's crazy like.""
Uptown Funk, sung by Bruno Mars, has been available digitally for a few weeks and was due for release in the UK on 11 January.
Some bookmakers have now suspended bets on the song, sung by Bruno or Fleur, reaching Christmas number one.
Fleur says the music team on the show were surprised at the success: ""I think straight away they were like oh wow, what's happened here? So they had to speed up the release date.""
Ladbrokes stopped taking bets late on Monday night.
Other bookmakers slashed their odds, with William Hill offering 7/1, making Uptown Funk its third favourite for the festive top spot, after The X Factor winner's single and Band Aid 30.
But Fleur says she hopes Mark Ronson's good gesture won't affect the success of his hard work: ""It would be a shame in many ways, obviously because it was their song and they created it, it would only be right that theirs got to number one.""

916,"It is unusual for any Formula 1 boss to openly admit their team have made an error; and from Ferrari's Maurizio Arrivabene - any Ferrari team principal, for that matter - it is rarer than most.
But after the Canadian Grand Prix, there was no mistaking Arrivabene's message when he was asked about the fateful strategy decision that probably cost Sebastian Vettel victory in the Canadian Grand Prix.
""We overestimated the degradation of the tyres,"" Arrivabene said. ""This is the reason we called him in. It was the wrong decision.""
And so it was.
It has been a frustrating start to the season for Ferrari, who have talked themselves up - and been talked up by Mercedes - but, before the weekend in Montreal, had only flattered to deceive.
Around the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, though, they finally looked like the real deal.
Vettel missed out on pole position by less than 0.2 seconds, and had to be content with third on the grid behind Mercedes team-mates Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg. But he was optimistic of a decent race, and his blistering start made a win look on.
It was the sort of start that helped form the legend of one of Ferrari's biggest heroes, Gilles Villeneuve, back in the late 1970s and early '80s - on a completely different scale than every other car on the grid.
The new rules introduced this year, restricting the assistance drivers can receive from both the pit wall and in the car, have made this sort of disparity possible again.
Hamilton is suffering at one end of the spectrum; Vettel benefiting at the other. And in Canada, the four-time champion got off the line as if powered by a rocket, and was past both Mercedes within 100 metres or so.
From there, he tried to run the start of the race as he did in his Red Bull days - build a quick lead with a blistering first couple of laps and then hold it, eking out the tyres, keeping his rivals at arm's length.
Hamilton admitted to being impressed by the Ferrari's initial pace, but a fastest lap by the world champion on lap three made it obvious it would not be that easy. And from there Hamilton was comfortably able to sit within 1.5 seconds of the Ferrari - the smallest margin a driver can allow before risking wrecking the fragile Pirelli tyres.
Still, track position is critical in F1, especially between cars that are relatively evenly matched, even on a circuit on which overtaking is as common as it is in Montreal.
Critically - and oddly - Ferrari chose to surrender it.
It made sense on a micro level - the virtual safety car was enforced while Jenson Button's smoking and broken McLaren-Honda was recovered, and Ferrari took the opportunity afforded by everyone being held to a slow pace to make a pit stop that as a result would cost less time than normal.
But on a macro level, it was a misjudgement.
Hamilton did not stop - and would only do so once. So to get the lead back and win the race, Vettel would now have to a) pass the two Red Bulls while also trying to close down Hamilton's lead; b) prevent Hamilton from closing in on him after the Briton's sole pit stop when the Mercedes would have fresher tyres; and c) catch and then pass a fundamentally faster car in the final stint of the race.
That was always going to be a long shot.
There were echoes here of the first race of the season in Australia, when Vettel was again leading unexpectedly after a stunning start, and Ferrari again chose to surrender it.
Back then it was by switching to super-soft tyres when the race was stopped, forcing themselves to stop again, while Mercedes went for tyres that would get them to the end of the race.
If Vettel was cross at losing his second potential win in seven races, he hid it very well.
""We have very strong people on board making decisions and I don't want them to be criticised,"" he said.
""With hindsight it is always very easy, but I will always defend what we did.""
It's not hard to see at times like this why Ferrari love Vettel. Like Michael Schumacher before him, he believes that if hard words are to be said, it should be behind closed doors; anything else is counter-productive.
Ferrari technical director James Allison - who has worked with an elite group of drivers that includes Schumacher and Fernando Alonso - recognises this as one of Vettel's greatest strengths.
""I have worked with two guys who really, really understand the value of being in a team and one was Michael and the other is Sebastian,"" he told BBC F1's Tom Clarkson last season.
The positives for Ferrari go beyond Vettel's attitude, though. Most importantly, they were genuinely quick again, even if not quite on Mercedes' pace.
It has been an odd season for the Maranello team. Mercedes have always insisted their concern about Ferrari is genuine, saying the car has real speed, but that circumstances had prevented them showing it.
You could see what they meant. First there was the strategy bungle in Australia. Then in Bahrain an engine failure on the formation lap for Vettel and a bad start for team-mate Kimi Raikkonen put them out of the fight for victory.
In China, Vettel and Raikkonen collided at the first corner; in Russia, Vettel was taken out on the first lap by Red Bull's Daniil Kvyat. In Spain, they bungled Vettel's strategy trying to pass the Red Bulls.
But the longer it has gone on, the more it has looked like Ferrari were not quite there.
They would appear to be quick in practice, only for Mercedes to stretch ahead in when it mattered.
In both Spain and Monaco, they mysteriously lost pace in qualifying, blaming not getting the difficult-to-manage Pirelli tyres in the right operating window.
Their understanding of the tyres' vagaries does seem behind that of Mercedes - and perhaps this led to their mistake on Sunday.
Before Canada, Ferrari's average qualifying deficit to Mercedes was only 0.075secs less than it had been in 2015 - and was a still-massive 0.779secs.
For Montreal, they introduced a new turbo, and it seemed to make a big difference, Vettel qualifying only 0.178secs off pole, and was strong - if not quite Mercedes fast - in the race.
""We desperately wanted to win,"" Vettel said. ""We didn't, but we showed the car is quick, it has potential. We are moving forward with a lot of confidence. The team is on a great path.""
It will take more races to judge whether Canada was a one-off. But at least Ferrari have something to hang on to again.
""Look where the car and engine were in 2014 and look where we are now,"" Vettel said. ""The team is making immense progress and we are challenging an opponent who two years ago was supposed to be untouchable. There will be a point when we start to be ahead.""
Four weeks ago, Lewis Hamilton had just crashed out of the Spanish Grand Prix with team-mate Nico Rosberg and was staring down the barrel of a 43-point deficit in the championship with nearly a quarter of the season gone.
Two races later, that deficit has been cut to just nine points, after two very different but equally-impressive victories in Monaco and Canada.
In both, Hamilton owed his win to a stroke of fortune - in Monaco, a bungled pit stop by Red Bull; in Montreal, a strategic blunder by Ferrari.
But in each case, Hamilton still had plenty to do, and has performed his task with the sort of judgement and expertise that befits a three-time world champion.
Even after falling nearly two race wins behind Rosberg after a troubled first four races, there was always the sense that somehow Hamilton would come through in the end this year.
That now looks a much less arduous task than it did after Rosberg's four opening victories, even if there are pot holes ahead for Hamilton.
The turbo and hybrid failures he suffered in qualifying in China and Russia mean he is already short of engine parts and by inevitably exceeding his permitted allowance, he will receive grid penalties at some point.
But he has now taken pole at every race in which he has not suffered a mechanical problem in qualifying; and won two straight in impressive style.
""I'm really overwhelmed to think just how difficult this season was before these last two races,"" he said.
""I'm super-focused. I felt that was one of my best races for a while, maybe not as good as the last one, but I'm still really happy with it.""","Ferrari boss Maurizio Arrivabene has admitted that his team made a mistake in strategy that cost Sebastian Vettel victory in the Canadian Grand Prix.

919,"The Toffees willingly soaked up 71% of City possession but restricted Guardiola's side to few chances and scored with four of just six attempts at goal.
Romelu Lukaku coolly side-footed in a Kevin Mirallas cut-back and the Belgium internationals combined again after the break, Mirallas drilling Lukaku's through-ball across the keeper.
Tom Davies sent Goodison Park into raptures on just his second league start by dinking a third over Claudio Bravo and £11m debutant Ademola Lookman fired between the legs of the keeper in injury time.
Goals from the two teenagers left Everton boss Ronald Koeman visibly elated, while Guardiola cut a frustrated figure, remonstrating with the fourth official late on in what is his heaviest ever league defeat as a manager.
City lacked cutting edge throughout, though had Davies not headed a looping Bacary Sagna header off the line before half-time, they may not have gone on to suffer a fifth league defeat of the season.
They stay fifth, 10 points off leaders Chelsea, while Everton remain seventh.
What a difference a week makes. After FA Cup defeat to Leicester last weekend an angry Koeman demanded the club's hierarchy ""opened its eyes"".
The £24m signing of Morgan Schneiderlin lifted some gloom but the roars for his 65th-minute appearance from the bench were dwarfed by the noise in injury time when Lookman, newly arrived from Charlton, made his mark.
Koeman was bold in starting with Davies and 20-year-old defender Mason Holgate, but pragmatic in his game plan. City have had over 50% of the ball in every league outing this season but Everton sat and soaked up possession comfortably.
Leighton Baines slid in to deny Raheem Sterling an opening early on and, Davies' header off the line apart, the home goal never looked under serious threat.
The Toffees ran further and produced more sprints than the visitors, while with the ball they were direct, springing attacks through Lukaku, who proved a handful for City's ragged back four.
Davies ran further than anyone on the pitch and released Mirallas in the build-up to the opening goal, before being involved in the second and cleverly chipping in the third after a driving run from his own half.
Schneiderlin could threaten the 18-year-old's place but Koeman will welcome such a selection dilemma.
The Dutchman knows his team are far from a finished article but this win showed all they could be.
""It looks like the title challenge is beyond City,"" BBC Radio 5 live pundit Kevin Kilbane said at the end of match where the visitors' soft centre was all too apparent and clinically exploited.
After 10 games of the season Guardiola's side topped the table on 23 points, but 11 matches later he now says they are too far adrift.
The warning signs were there in those opening 10 games, where City kept two only clean sheets.
Their defensive predicament has continued and at Goodison Everton's direct balls repeatedly took the City midfield out of the game, exposing a back four which seemed to have little understanding as a unit.
Vincent Kompany's persistent injuries have created a hole in the heart of defence that John Stones and Nicolas Otamendi have been unable to fill with authority, while in central midfield, Pablo Zabaleta's performance was robust but his quality on the ball is no substitute for the silky Ilkay Gundogan.
Zabaleta had played 30 passes by the time he went off on the hour, 40 fewer than Yaya Toure.
Individual mistakes also proved costly. Toure took a heavy touch for Everton's killer second goal, while Gael Clichy sloppily lost possession for the first.
City have now conceded more goals than any other in the top seven, while goalkeeper Bravo has been beaten by 14 of the last 22 shots on target.
Guardiola has answers to find.

The NSPCC said the cases were ""the visible peak"" of a much larger problem.
The Local Government Association said councils ""work hard to ensure support is available"".
The Victoria Derbyshire programme submitted Freedom of Information requests to 152 councils with adult social services responsibilities (CASSRs) in England, asking how many reports of sexual abuse of disabled clients they had recorded over the financial years 2013-14 and 2014-15, up to 16 February 2015.
Data received from 106 of the 152 councils showed that 63% of the 4,748 reported cases were against those with learning disabilities, and 37% against those with physical disabilities.
No comparable figures have previously been collated.
Jon Brown, head of sexual abuse programmes at the children's charity NSPCC, described the 4,748 cases of reported abuse as ""the visible peak"" of a much larger problem.
""We know with sexual abuse that many victims find it difficult to speak out,"" he added, suggesting the real figure may be much greater.
While the Freedom of Information request related just to adult cases, he explained: ""We know from research that disabled children and young people are three or four times more likely to be abused and neglected than children and young people who are not disabled.
""Abusers are often very adept at identifying vulnerabilities. And, importantly, we know that it's less likely for children and young people to be believed as well.""
Noelle Blackman, chief executive of the charity Respond, said she had seen ""some horrendous cases"" among the young people who have been referred to it for help. ""Certainly from the age of 13,"" she added, ""but sometimes younger"".
She continued: ""What we're really noticing at the moment is young people being abused by other young people.""
""Often the perpetrators don't have a learning disability, and often there will be gangs of boys who don't have a disability who are grooming girls who do, which is a really worrying trend.""
Both charities believe more needs to be done to tackle the problem. Respond calls for more resources to be placed into raising awareness of the issue, while the NSPCC believes better training for professionals and parents is required to ensure more young people are willing to report abuse.
The Local Government Association (LGA) said ""keeping people safe, including people with learning disabilities, is one of the most important things councils do"".
It added that ""councils work hard to ensure support is available when cases of abuse are referred"".

She takes referrals from all over the country and supports women in the most severe cases.

The UK will take in about 400 refugees a month, chosen by the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR. The Local Government Association has called for more resources to help house people. Prime Minister David Cameron has said people would come from camps bordering Syria, rather than among those already in Europe. Central European ministers have rejected a mandatory quota system for sharing out migrant arrivals.</s>",mistral7b,XSUM,
927,"GPS jammers are believed to be mostly used by people driving vehicles fitted with tracking devices in order to mask their whereabouts.
In one location the Sentinel study recorded more than 60 GPS jamming incidents in six months.
The research follows concern that jammers could interfere with critical systems which rely on GPS.
The team behind the research believes it is the first study of its kind in the UK.
Its findings will be presented at the GNSS Vulnerability 2012: Present Danger, Future Threats conference held at the National Physical Laboratory on Wednesday.
The Sentinel research project used 20 roadside monitors to detect jammer use.
""We think it's the only system of its kind in the world,"" Bob Cockshott of the ICT Knowledge Transfer Network and organiser of the conference told the BBC.
The sensors recorded every time a vehicle with a jammer passed by.
""We believe there's between 50 and 450 occurrences in the UK every day,"" said Charles Curry of Chronos Technology, the company leading the project, though he stressed that they were still analysing the data.
He told the BBC that evidence from the project suggested that most jammers were small portable devices with an area of effect of between 200m and 300m.
The project received Â£1.5m funding from the Technology Strategy Board and involved a number of partners including the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO).
Mr Curry said the research had also resulted in the detection and confiscation by the police of one jammer.
""We detected a pattern and they [the police] were able to go and sit and wait,"" he said.
Mr Curry said the research was also able to establish that jammers were responsible for interference experienced by Ordnance Survey equipment.
GPS jammers are widely available online, one reason Mr Cockshott believes the law around jammers needs tightening.
He thinks the Sentinel project should now work towards developing systems that will help catch those using jammers.
""The next step is to develop the system further so that it can be used for enforcement, so that you can detect a jammer in use and then relate it to the driver that's using it,"" he said.
Logistics and other companies often install GPS trackers so they can follow the movements of vehicles.
They are also used so vehicles carrying valuable loads can be tracked.
Researchers believe most GPS jammers are used to stop these devices working.
""A GPS satellite emits no more power than a car headlight, and with that it has to illuminate half the Earth's surface,"" Prof David Last, a past president of the Royal Institute of Navigation, told the BBC.
""A very, very low power jammer that broadcasts on the same radio frequency as the GPS will drown it out.
""Most of them are used by people who don't want their vehicles to be tracked,"" he said.
But the jamming technology can cause problems for other safety-critical systems using GPS.
In mobile phone and power networks GPS satellite signals are sometimes used as a source of accurate timing information.
GPS is even used to provide accurate time information for some computerised transactions in financial markets.
And other GPS navigation devices used by ships and light aircraft could also be affected by jammers.
In 2009 Newark airport in the US found some of its GPS based systems were suffering repeated interference.
The problem was eventually traced back to a truck driver using a GPS jammer.","The Sentinel study recorded over 60 GPS jamming incidents in six months in one location.

928,"British-born Shia cleric Sheikh Farrokh Sekaleshfar lectured near Orlando, Florida in April and was being widely quoted in the wake of Sunday's killing.
He was visiting Australia as a guest of Sydney's Imam Husain Islamic Centre.
Media reports on Wednesday said Sheikh Sekaleshfar left the country after Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull ordered a review of his visa.
Australia's immigration minister Peter Dutton said he had officially revoked Sheikh Sekaleshfar's visa and that it would be ""very difficult, if not impossible for him to return"" to the country.
But Mr Dutton defended his department against accusations that a visa for the sheik should never have been approved.
'It's difficult for the department to go through the Facebook or social media postings of millions of millions of people each year who seek visas,' Mr Dutton told Sky News.
Sheikh Sekaleshfar was born in Manchester, UK and currently lives in Iran.
In April he delivered a sermon entitled How to Deal with the Phenomenon of Homosexuality at the Husseini Islamic Center in Sanford, Florida.
There is no evidence that Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people at an Orlando nightclub, attended the lecture.
During lectures, clips of which were posted online, the cleric has said the death penalty is justified for homosexuals in societies operating under Islamic laws.
""Death is the sentence. There's nothing to be embarrassed about this. Death is the sentence,"" he said during a 2013 lecture at the University of Michigan.
He told Australia's Daily Telegraph newspaper that his comments had been taken out of context and said he did not believe his words could have inspired Mateen's nightclub attack.
Sheikh Sekaleshfar said Mateen was a follower of the so-called Islamic State, which follows the Wahabi doctrine of Sunni Islam and had been ""killing homosexuals in the most wrongful way for years now"", whereas he was a Shia scholar.
""This barbaric act was beyond all definitions of humanity,"" he told the paper.","British-born Shia cleric Sheikh Farrokh Sekaleshfar was visiting Australia as a guest of Sydney's Imam Husain Islamic Centre.

929,"As home secretary campaigning to stay in the European Union, she described it as ""inconceivable"" that Brexit would not lead to changes to the border arrangements between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.
It is important because once the UK leaves, it will be the only land border between the UK and the European Union.
The current arrangements significantly pre-date the formation of the EU.
The UK and Ireland entered into a Common Travel Area (CTA) agreement in 1923. This is an informal travel arrangement that means that no passport controls are in operation for Irish and UK citizens travelling between the two countries. It's been updated a couple of times since then.
During the Troubles there were frequent road closures and checkpoints at the border and in Belfast on Monday, Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""Nobody wants to return to the borders of the past.""
But it is by no means a foregone conclusion that the situation can remain unchanged - the UK and Ireland joined the European Community (which later became the EU)  on the same day, so the border has never been one between a member and a non-member.
Ireland is not currently part of the passport-free Schengen zone, which does mean that visitors entering Ireland from another EU country will already have had their passports checked.
Much will come down to what happens in the UK's negotiations to leave the EU, particularly whether freedom of movement continues. It will also be important whether the UK decides to remain part of the European Economic Area, although there are some customs checks even between Norway, which is an EEA member and Sweden, which is an EU member.
There has also been legal advice that any agreement between the UK and Irish Republic would have to be agreed by the whole of the EU.
Professor Dagmar Schiek, Jean Monnet chair of EU Law and Policy at Queens University Belfast, is quoted in a report by the Northern Ireland affairs committee as saying: ""Under EU law, any future relations between the Republic of Ireland and the UK would be subject to agreement not only with the Republic of Ireland, but with the whole of the EU"".
One suggested solution is that the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland should remain open, but there would then be a border between the island of Ireland and the rest of the UK, which would have the advantage of not being a land border.
But First Minister Arlene Foster said she had told Theresa May: ""There must be no internal borders within the United Kingdom, and I was very clear with her on that and she responded positively to that.""

Mr Nutley said: ""The contract was coming to an end, we had a look at whether we wanted to renew and decided medical services were by and large being provided in these wards.

And Roberto Mancini's men could not have delivered a more emphatic statement as Sir Alex Ferguson's side were humiliated.
It was the first time United had conceded six goals at Old Trafford since 1930, when Huddersfield won 6-0 and Newcastle 7-4 within four days of each other.
Media playback is not supported on this device
City led just 1-0 at half-time, but the second half was completely one-sided and the eventual margin of victory could have been even more convincing.
Mario Balotelli, in the headlines for accidentally setting his house ablaze with fireworks, put City on their way with goals either side of the interval as United struggled to contain the array of attacking talent in front of them.
United were reduced to 10 men when Jonny Evans was sent off early in the second half but City's superiority was such that they looked on course for a landmark victory from the moment they took the lead.
Sergio Aguero added a third and, even though Darren Fletcher pulled a goal back, this only proved the signal for a late surge by City that brought three more goals and a result that will have sent shockwaves through the Premier League.
Substitute Edin Dzeko scrambled in a fourth and the magnificent David Silva ran clear to add another, before the Bosnian striker inflicted the final wound seconds from the end.
Man City
Man Utd
As Ferguson strode briskly towards the Stretford End at the final whistle, he will have been reflecting on the extent of the challenge now facing him from the club he once branded ""noisy neighbours"".
To increase United's pain, this was their first home defeat in any competition since April 2010, when they lost to Chelsea - but even that defeat, which effectively cost them the title, may not turn out to have the same long-term significance as this heavy beating.
United's stature is such that one result must not bring the immediate announcement of a shift in the balance of power in Manchester - but the swathes of empty seats around Old Trafford and the wave of attacks pouring towards David de Gea's goal in the second half emphasised that City quite simply have greater firepower and talent in their squad at present.
Mancini left Samir Nasri and Dzeko on the bench - but was still able to exploit a wide range of attacking options in Balotelli, Silva and Aguero.
In contrast to what was to come, City were barely allowed any time to settle on the ball in the opening exchanges, with Ashley Young prominent and drawing heavy fouls from Micah Richards and James Milner.
And it was against the run of play that City took the lead after 22 minutes, courtesy of a stroke of casual quality from Balotelli. Silva was the creator but Balotelli, given too much time and space by Evans, finished sublimely with a stroked finish into the bottom corner.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Balotelli, in recognition of those latest chaotic events in his personal life, then revealed a T-shirt bearing the slogan ""Why Always Me?"". Despite the evident good humour of the gesture, he was booked by referee Mark Clattenburg.
United's hopes of mounting a serious response suffered a blow within two minutes of the restart when Evans, who had endured a miserable afternoon, lost concentration and allowed Balotelli to steal in behind him. The defender's only reaction was to haul the Italian down, resulting in an inevitable red card.
The opportunity was there for City to overpower their arch-rivals and they accepted it as they went in search of further goals to emphasise their supremacy.
City doubled their lead on the hour with another superbly created goal finished by Balotelli. Silva cleverly played in Milner, who provided a cross that left the striker with the simplest of goals from close range.
Aguero had been quieter than his attacking colleagues but got in on the act after 69 minutes. The outstanding Milner played in Richards and, once again, a delivery across the face of the goal proved too much for United, Argentine Aguero arriving to complete the formalities.
Mancini then removed Balotelli and introduced Dzeko, who almost scored a fourth within seconds of his arrival, only to see his shot drift inches wide.
And, with United chasing a lost cause and leaving space at the back, Silva fired over from 10 yards and Dzeko forced a fine save from De Gea when he was set free by the Spaniard.
United refused to give up even in the face of impossible odds and Fletcher offered some hope when he pulled one back with nine minutes left, striking a fine rising shot from 20 yards that gave Joe Hart no chance.
It was a goal for which the phrase ""false dawn"" was invented. Dzeko took advantage of good work from Joleon Lescott to score the fourth before Silva got the goal he deserved with a composed strike.
And with some United supporters actually pleading with referee Clattenburg to put them out of their misery, one more moment of brilliance from the magical Silva found Dzeko surging into the area to finish left-footed for his second.

A review petition was dismissed on Monday. The attorney general said there was now no reason why he could not be executed.
Kamaruzzaman's lawyers could decide to seek mercy from the president.
The 62-year-old was convicted of crimes committed during the country's war of independence from Pakistan in 1971, including a mass killing of at least 120 unarmed farmers in the northern border town of Sohagpur.
Three women widowed as a result of the killings testified against Kamaruzzaman during his trial. They described how he led Pakistani troops to the village and helped the soldiers to line up and execute the farmers.
An appeal court in November last year upheld the verdict and a sentence of death by hanging.
But Kamaruzzaman's lawyers made a last-ditch legal appeal, arguing that there were ""serious discrepancies"" in the testimonies of prosecution witnesses at his trial.
That has now been rejected by the Chief Justice of Bangladesh, S K Sinha.

944,"The game appeared in severe danger of being abandoned after half-time when the pitch became shrouded in thick fog.
However the Republic looked to have snatched victory when Robbie Brady hit a precious away goal on 82 minutes.
But Edin Dzeko levelled three minutes later to leave the play-off in the balance going into Monday's second leg.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Republic manager Martin O'Neill will hope the possible return of Shane Long, Jon Walters and John O'Shea will give them impetus for the Dublin contest.
Southampton striker Long may be available again after injury while O'Neill may also welcome back the influential O'Shea and Walters after suspension.
With the Republic having scored the away goal, a 0-0 draw at the Aviva Stadium will be enough to secure the Irish a finals berth in France.
Brady struggled for much of the contest as both he and Republic left-back Stephen Ward found Bosnia right-sided midfielder Edin Visca a handful.
The Norwich winger's goal came in his only piece of attacking play of note as he cut inside Toni Sunuci before beating Bosnia's Chelsea goalkeeper Asmir Begovic at his near post with a shot from 14 yards.
Brady's goal could hardly be seen from the stands such was the fog that had enveloped the Bilino Polje Stadium in Zenica.
At that stage, the Irish - after being second best for most of the contest - looked on course to be in firm control of the play-off going into the second leg.
However, the Republic's left-sided flank was once again exploited three minutes later as Ognjen Vranjes got in behind Ireland substitute James McClean before squaring for Roma star Dzeko to poke past Darren Randolph.
With Visca a threat from early on, the Republic had a couple of nervous first-half moments as Vedad Ibisevic fired into the side-netting from close range and Senad Lulic then failed to divert an Ervin Zukanovic header past Randolph, when only a touch was needed.
However, Bosnia playmaker Miralem Pjanic struggled to impose himself on the contest while his Roma team-mate Dzeko was well shackled by the impressive Derby defender Richard Keogh.
The Republic scarcely created an attacking opening in the first period but the visitors would still have been the far happier outfit at the interval given their list of absentees.
There were few chances at either end in the opening 37 minutes of the second half, with the players perhaps affected by the thick fog that filled the stadium.
Visca continued to be the game's most influential performer but Bosnia manager Mehmed Bazdarevic made the baffling decision to take off the right-sided player with over 20 minutes left.
With that decision, the match appeared likely to peter out into a goal-less draw before Brady pounced on Edin Cocalic's attempted clearance then cut inside Sunjic to fire past Begovic.
The Republic had only eight minutes plus injury-time to hold out but they couldn't manage it as substitute Vranjes managed to get in between McClean and another replacement, Marc Wilson, before finding the unmarked Dzeko on the edge of the six-yard box.
In John O'Shea's absence, Derby County's Keogh produced a typically committed display as he and central defensive partner Ciaran Clark largely subdued Bosnia dangerman Dzeko.
Republic of Ireland defender Ciaran Clark: "" It was a good performance defensively, but this game is done now and we have to concentrate and get ready for the game on Monday night now.
""We are confident we can go out there and get a result. It's going to be a tough game for both teams for sure, we have got the away goal.""
Bosnia coach Mehmed Bazdarevic: ""It was difficult to relay instructions to the players in the second half because we could barely see anything at all from the dug-out.
""We are a bit disappointed with the result but I have to admit that we didn't play well, perhaps because we weren't composed enough.""

949,"It fell again today - a move some are interpreting as a second devaluation.
However, the system China has put in place means the yuan could, in theory, keep on devaluing.
As long as it decides it wants it to.
For the first time the central bank is allowing the market to play a part in setting the exchange rate.
The central bank, the People's Bank of China, said in a statement: ""Since China's trade in goods continues to post relatively large surpluses, the yuan's real effective exchange rate is still relatively strong versus various global currencies, and is deviating from market expectations.
""Therefore, it is necessary to further improve the yuan's midpoint pricing to meet the needs of the market.""
Before Monday the official rate for the yuan or renminbi was arbitrarily fixed each day by the bank.
Since then bank has said it will still fix the rate, but will base it on the level it reached in the market on the previous day.
So in theory the market will dictate the rate at which the yuan is traded at at the beginning of each day.
The devaluations of the last two days have therefore been in response to the downward pressure of the market on the currency, with Wednesday's opening rate reflecting Tuesday's close.
However, in reality the central bank will intervene in the market to keep some control over the exchange rate.
On Wednesday the yuan fell almost 2% during the day as investors aggressively sold it off.
But it was then yanked back by the central bank buying equally aggressively just before the close. So the new trading level on Thursday will be only 0.8% lower than the start of the previous day's trade.
Jonathan Fenby, managing director of the China team at Trusted Sources believes that the central bank really is moving towards liberalisation.
He said: ""What you've done is gone to market fixing for the currency. It's still controlled. There's still a 2% band either side of the fixing. But this is a move towards market liberalisation.""
He says that there is a genuine desire among the reformers in the government to liberalise the exchange rate as well as to stimulate the economy through a devaluation.
He said: ""The reformers in China, the modernisers, want the economy, everything, including the currency to be much more affected by, and set by, market forces rather than by the authorisation of a one party state.""","China has allowed the market to play a part in setting the exchange rate of its currency, the yuan.

Shadow Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens quit last week over the issue - other senior MPs say they will rebel.
Mr Corbyn has ordered all Labour MPs to support the bill triggering Article 50.
Labour backed the campaign to keep the UK in the EU in the referendum in June and many Labour MPs represent constituencies which voted for Remain.
But many seats which voted to leave the EU are also represented by Labour MPs.
Mr Corbyn says he understands the pressures on MPs in pro-Remain constituencies but has called on them to unite around the important issues.
His shadow home secretary Diane Abbott has said that, since a UK-wide referendum with a 72% turnout returned a vote in favour of withdrawing from the EU, it would ""be very undermining of democracy"" for MPs to vote against beginning the formal process of leaving.
Ms Stevens quit on Friday saying Brexit was a ""terrible mistake"". Shadow minister Tulip Siddiq also quit last week saying she would vote against the EU (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill.
Two Labour whips, Jeff Smith and Thangam Debbonaire, who are in charge of party discipline, have also said they will rebel - though they have not resigned.

The bill is due to be debated by MPs on Tuesday - in a sitting that may last until midnight - and clear the Commons on 8 February, after which it will move to the House of Lords.

951,"And children's author Jacqueline Wilson agrees diary writing ""increases your fluency and helps you become more comfortable at expressing yourself"".
The Tracy Beaker author says she herself wrote a diary from the age of seven or eight and continued through her childhood and into her teens.
She is backing a campaign for children to be given diaries this Christmas.
Ms Wilson told BBC Breakfast she thinks writing a diary has a massive advantage over social media when it comes to expressing innermost thoughts and feelings.
The point is diaries are ""not for sharing"", she argued.
""You don't care how many people like it. It's just for you. You can write anything you want down.""
A diary entry could be an account of your day, what you really feel about people you absolutely love, or people you hate, your hopes and ambitions, she said.
And if you are really into sport you can use the diary for detailed accounts of matches you have watched, she suggested.
Tracy Beaker is partly written in diary form and Ms Wilson says she still uses her teenage diaries as a source of inspiration in some of her writing... even though ""they are terribly embarrassing to look back on... you care so passionately about things.""
Other famous diaries in children's literature are:
For older readers there are the works of Samuel Pepys, James Boswell, Virginia Woolf and Anne Frank - and on a rather more frivolous note: Bridget Jones.
Data on more than 3,000 eight-to 11-year-olds, collected by the charity, suggests that pupils who keep a diary are almost twice as likely to write above the expected level for their age (27.1%), compared with children who do not (15.5%).
The main attraction of writing a diary is being able to choose the subject matter and 82% of girls and 76% of boys told the researchers that writing is more fun if they are allowed to decide what to write about.
The research also found:
National Literacy Trust director, Jonathan Douglas, said the charity was ""encouraging parents, families and anyone buying a gift for a child or young person this Christmas to give the gift of a diary.
""You'll be giving them a platform to express themselves through words and the tools to become a better writer and do well at school. And you never know - your child could produce the next Diary of a Wimpy Kid!""","Jacqueline Wilson, the author of the Tracy Beaker series, believes that diary writing can improve fluency and self-expression. She writes diaries and uses them as a source of inspiration for her writing.

IS operates some 40 media operations across the territory it controls, is attempting to seize or claims to have an operational presence. Most of the output is in Arabic, but many reports are translated into English and other target languages.
Over the course of a month, the counter-extremism think tank logged all announcements, broadcasts and publications which it said could be clearly attributed to the group's media teams.
Quilliam recorded almost 900 individual online messages and publications covering one of six core propaganda themes: war, brutality, victimhood, mercy, belonging and civilian life.
Charlie Winter, the study's author, said: ""The overall narrative has shifted in favour of victimhood, war and utopianism.
""The brutality, mercy and belonging narratives are still present - but instances of those three are vastly outnumbered by the others.""
In the 469 instances which focused on statehood, IS media teams sought to prove that it was capable of administering land under its control - including examples of supposedly functioning public services and economic life.

962,"It was supposed to be straightforward. A week-long barrage from 3,000 Allied artillery units had landed three million shells on the German lines.
The theory was that the Germans would have fled or been killed, the barbed wire cut. All the Allies had to do was walk across no-man's land and take the enemy's trenches.
That was the theory. But the wire hadn't been cut, the Germans hadn't been killed and the trenches were most certainly not empty.
The men clambering into the breach were met with a hail of bombs and bullets.
A battle began which would drag on for 141 days; a battle which cost around a million lives by its end; a battle which would be etched into the collective memory of Britain. And Ireland.
The Irish were well represented in the melting pot of nationalities in the Allied trenches.
They came from an island which, by the time the First World War began in August 1914,  was on the brink of civil war.
The crisis in Ireland was brought about by the possibility of Home Rule - something favoured by the Catholic, nationalist southern part of the island; but resisted in the Protestant, unionist north.
The Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) had been formed in 1912 to stop Home Rule.
The nationalist Irish Volunteers formed in reaction.
Both sides had landed German-made Mauser rifles in preparation for a showdown which never came.
On 28 June 1914, a young nationalist of a different kind - a Bosnian - fired the shots which would start a world war.
In Sarajevo, Gavrilo Princip assassinated the Austro-Hungarian heir Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife.
Europe slid towards war. A war which would put pause to the Irish Home Rule crisis.
Britain knew it needed more men for the campaign. The Secretary of State for War, Lord Kitchener, appealed to civilian men to heed the call.
Ireland responded.
Volunteers
The unionist leader and MP Edward Carson sought assurances that the Home Rule bill would be suspended for the duration of the war before he would commit the UVF to the fray.
He got those assurances, and the Ulster Volunteers formed the basis of an entire division, which became the 36th Ulster Division.
Nationalism, too, answered the call.
Irish Parliamentary Party leader John Redmond urged Irishmen to join up. The reward for loyal service would be Home Rule after the war.
Thousands did join. But others did not and would go on to play a part in the Easter Rising of 1916, a failed military strike against British rule.
It was in this context that Irishmen - Protestant and Catholic, unionist and nationalist - found themselves in trenches stretching across northern France.
The 'blood sacrifice' of the 36th Ulster Division was made on the first day of the Battle of the Somme.
On 1 July 1916, its target was the Schwaben Redoubt - a fortified stronghold on the German line near the village of Thiepval.
It was one of the few British divisions to attain its objective that day, much to the surprise of the defending Germans.
The achievement of the inexperienced Ulstermen was remarkable. A slog uphill, across a thousand yards, towards machine gun nests and the determined riflemen of the German army.
Their success came with horrific losses. By the end of the day the division had suffered more than 5,000 casualties, around 2,000 of whom lay dead.
By mid afternoon on 1 July, the soldiers of the 36th found themselves fighting on three sides and were driven back to their starting position late in the day.
The Irish contingent facing German guns on the first day of the battle was not just made up of Ulstermen. The men of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers were there too.
The main offensive by Irish nationalist troops during the Battle of the Somme came in September - by the men of the 16th Irish Division.
These were generally Catholic men, many of whom had been in the Irish Volunteers.
The assaults on the villages of Guillemont and Ginchy resulted in another brutal casualty rate - about 4,300 men killed or wounded in a six day period.
These two actions - in July and September 1916 - along with continual casualties throughout the battle, meant there was virtually no corner of Ireland left unaffected by the Somme.
The losses were felt even more keenly given the nature and make up of the 36th and 16th divisions.
They had been volunteers who, in many cases, came from the same streets, or worked alongside, or went to the same church, as the man standing beside them.
They knew each other well and dealt with the muck and mire together, killed for one another and watched each other die.
For those who survived the Battle of the Somme and the remaining two years of the war, the Ireland to which they returned was very different to that which they left.
For northern Protestant unionists, the sacrifice on French fields was seen as a price paid to ensure that Ulster would remain British.
Demands were made of the British government and those demands were eventually met - six of Ulster's nine counties remained in the United Kingdom when Ireland was partitioned in 1922.
For its part, nationalism had some idea of 'blood sacrifice' too - Ireland had bled for Britain, and was deserving of her freedom.
But the drive for self-determination had been split by the war.
Indeed, nationalists had fought for Britain in 1916, while others had rebelled against the crown's forces in the Easter Rising of that year.
Some men managed to do both. Like Emmet Dalton - a winner of the Military Cross in 1916; an IRA man during the Irish War of Independence by 1919; and subsequently a Major General in the Irish Free State's National Army in 1922.
As time went on, the 36th Ulster Division passed into unionist lore and was commemorated on memorials and on Orange banners.
There were marches in its honour, and murals are still visible in Belfast.
As Northern Ireland descended into the civil unrest in the 1960s which would evolve into the Troubles, a newly formed paramilitary group took the name of the Ulster Volunteer Force.
It was a deliberate move to evoke memories of those volunteers from 50 years previous who had defended Ulster from Home Rule.
To the south, the memory of the 16th Irish Division was initially preserved, even after Ireland's partition. Thousands attended Armistice Day events in Dublin in the 1920s.
Gradually, however, the stature of those Irishmen who fought for the British in the First World War was eroded.
Republicans spoke out against the 'Poppy Day' parades and there were incidents of violence at events in the 1930s.
When the Second World War broke out the 'Poppy Day' parades were banned to ensure Irish neutrality.
They resumed after the war, but the Irish Free State became a republic in 1949 and the soldiers who had died for king and empire were airbrushed from national memory.
However, in recent years, that circle has turned.
Now, there is recognition of the loss suffered by Irish families in the First World War - regardless of politics or religion.
On both sides of the border, in this centenary year, those from Ireland who fell during one of warfare's most bloody battles, will be remembered.","The document discusses the role of Irishmen in the Battle of the Somme during World War I. It explains how the crisis in Ireland was brought about by the possibility of Home Rule and how both sides, unionist and nationalist, answered the call to fight in the war. The document describes the success and horrific losses of the 36th Ulster Division on the first day of the battle and the subsequent assaults by Irish nationalist troops. It also discusses the impact of the battle on Ireland and how the memory of those who fought for Britain in the war has been eroded over time. However, the document concludes that there is now recognition of the loss suffered by Irish families in the war and that those from Ireland who fell will be remembered in this centenary year.</s>",mistral7b,XSUM,
963,"Lt-Gen Ben Hodges was speaking to the BBC's Hardtalk programme during large Nato exercises in north-western Poland.
""The Russians are able to move huge formations and lots of equipment a long distance very fast,"" he said.
Nato needs to have that speed too, he said. ""Three days' notification, we ought to be able to do that,"" he said.
More than 31,000 troops from 24 nations took part in Nato's Anaconda-16 exercises in Poland, from 7 to 17 June.
The day after they ended, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier warned Nato against ""sabre-rattling and warmongering"", calling for exercises to be replaced with more dialogue and co-operation with Russia. ""Whoever believes that symbolic tank parades in Eastern Europe bring more security, is mistaken,"" he told Bild newspaper.
Former Soviet bloc countries, now Nato members, were alarmed by Russia's rapid annexation of Crimea during the Ukraine crisis in March 2014. That operation caused the biggest chill in relations with Russia since the end of the Cold War in 1991.
Russia's occupation of Georgian territory after a brief war in August 2008 also signalled a Russian readiness to intervene militarily in what it calls its ""neighbourhood"".
Nato's strategy towards Russia will be high on the agenda of a Nato summit in Warsaw next month.
Russia has held large military exercises near Ukraine's borders since the Crimea annexation and the uprising by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.
Nato has also complained of aggressive behaviour by Russian warplanes in the Baltic region. Russia, meanwhile, objects to Nato operating close to its borders, seeing the alliance as an aggressor.
""The thing I worry about the most is freedom of movement. Their snap exercises that they do, I personally am surprised each time they do it. And so you can see why that scares me,"" Gen Hodges said.
Since 2007 Russia has been training its forces to conduct ""any sort of operation"" on its borders, he said. A future crisis would probably involve ""hybrid"" warfare, including ""a nasty cyber environment"", he added.
Nato and Western leaders say there is clear evidence of Russia supplying heavy weapons and regular troops to the rebels who control a large swathe of Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Moscow denies that, but says some Russian ""volunteers"" are helping the rebels.
Gen Hodges said Nato should create a ""military Schengen zone"", to give the 28-nation alliance freedom of movement. Schengen is the EU's passport-free zone which encompasses most EU member states.
The general said it was ""concerning"" that Russia was able to deploy 20,000 troops and a lot of equipment ""on the border of a Nato country, or maybe somewhere like Georgia or Ukraine"".
""The Russians have what we call freedom of movement on the interior lines. They can move anywhere inside of Russia, as fast as they want.""
Nato is beefing up its presence closer to Russia's borders. It plans to deploy a battalion to Poland and three more to the neighbouring Baltic states - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - reaching a total of about 4,000 troops.
The deployment will be rotational, yet Poland wants permanent Nato bases to be set up in the region.
Gen Hodges said Nato was short of combat aircraft and short-range air defence in Eastern Europe. But he said Nato's deterrence was being bolstered by the US spending $3.4bn (£2.3bn) ""bringing equipment back into Europe"".
""I see it [Russia] as the only potential threat, that could destroy the United States, or the UK or Germany, or any other country. Because of their nuclear force. And they talk about nuclear weapons a lot,"" he said.","Nato is conducting large military exercises in Poland to improve its speed and ability to respond to potential threats.

Parker, who has defended the WBO title once since winning it in 2016, has only competed outside his native New Zealand in four of his 23 fights.

The Labour Party received clarification of the ruling from the Home Office and the Electoral Commission.
Mr Ashford said he was ""unhappy"" with the circumstances and wanted to apologise to his supporters.
In a statement on his website, Mr Ashford said that in 1966, aged 13, he was convicted of trespassing and being in possession of an offensive weapon.
He was fined Â£2, 10 shillings for both offences.
The Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 disqualifies a person from standing for election for a police and crime commissioner (PCC) if they have at any time been convicted of an offence for which a person could be sent to prison; whether or not they themselves were sent to prison for that offence.
Recalling the details of his offence, Mr Ashford said a group of boys from his school had persuaded him to go out with them and ""I felt I had little choice"".
He said: ""We went to the railway embankment and I felt very uncomfortable about this.
""One of the lads pulled out an air gun and started shooting at cans. I never touched the air gun and felt unable to leave, as I was frightened at what might happen at school.
""A goods train passed and presumably the guard reported our presence to the police who arrived a short time later.
""The lads with the air gun ran away whilst I and two others froze and were arrested.""
Mr Ashford said that to the best of his knowledge he was not questioned by police, but was told in court to plead guilty to both offences.
""I have just heard from a CRB check with my local police that no record of my case exists,"" he said.
But he added: ""To sign the declaration, knowing that I had committed an offence, would in itself be a criminal act which of course I am not prepared to countenance.""
Mr Ashford said that having worked with young offenders, he believed ""that all young people have worth and the ability to reform and lead productive and valuable lives as I have done"".
He said: ""It is deeply and bitterly ironic that I now find myself in a position where my prospective career and my work to date is to be overshadowed by an event which occurred 46 years ago and a piece of legislation which completely undermines those basic human rights.""
He said he had always declared this conviction throughout his career and during the PCC selection process.
Simon Duckworth, chairman of the transitional board of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, said: ""The government's rules on who can stand to be a police and crime commissioner tread a difficult line between ensuring the public can have full confidence in those who will police the police and the need to attract candidates of calibre to these demanding new roles.
""The public may feel that the automatic disqualification of candidates with a juvenile conviction, irrespective of the nature or date of the offence, is flawed; ultimately it prevents the public from making their own judgement about who's best to serve them as a PCC.""

But that has yet to be implemented because a power-sharing Stormont executive does not exist to pass it.
Victims have called on the parties to quickly agree a compensation process.

He also suggested that interim measures could be put in place to allow victims to receive a sum of money.
""Notwithstanding the political differences in Northern Ireland, we do actually care about those who have suffered,"" he said.
""We have a duty as political parties to respond to the needs of the victims.
""If we don't have an executive, we will find a way of taking this forward.

Jenkins says the pain of that defeat has stayed with the team, although only five of Saturday's starting XV played in the match that saw Sam Warburton sent off in the first half.
""We've still got a lot of hurt from that day and the game in Auckland when we lost 9-8 and missed out on a chance to play in a World Cup final,"" added Jenkins.
""We take a lot of pain from that to be truthful and it's stuck for a long time.
""But France are an outstanding side and a couple of games could have gone either way. Hopefully we can do it again tomorrow.""","Wales is set to face France in the Six Nations Championship match on Saturday. This will be the sixth consecutive match between the two sides since France lost to Wales in the 2011 World Cup. Wales has won five of the previous matches, two of them in Paris. The match is crucial for Wales as it could lift them to second place in the final table if other results go their way. Wales has been under pressure after losing to England and Scotland in their previous matches. Skills coach Neil Jenkins believes that Wales needs another good performance to atone for their lapses against Eddie Jones' Championship-winning side and a second-half capitulation against Scotland. Jenkins also believes that Wales needs to win the match to salvage three wins out of five.</s>",mistral7b,XSUM,

Sales in the clothing and home division have improved recently, but M&S has said more work was needed.
She fills the role left by Steve Rowe when he became M&S chief executive.
Mr Rowe said: ""Jill's first-class customer knowledge and great experience in running dynamic, high-achieving teams make her exactly the right person to lead this all-important part of our business from recovery into growth,"" he said.
Ms McDonald, who ran the UK arm of McDonald's before joining Halfords, said: ""I have long been an M&S customer and professional fan, so working with the brand was a career opportunity that I just couldn't turn down.""
She will join M&S in the autumn.
Mr Rowe has made it his mission to revive the clothing division, saying he wants to make it simpler and put customers back at the centre of its business.
But Ms McDonald has a tough job ahead of her.
M&S has suffered intense competition High Street rivals such as Zara, Primark and Topshop. Many of its traditional customers have complained of multiple clothing lines that have little to differentiate them and a lack of fashion-conscious vision.
Retail analyst Nick Bubb described Ms McDonald's appointment as a ""shock"".
""It goes without saying that there is nothing in her CV that would have implied that she was a candidate for this key position.
""It will be interesting to see how long she lasts,"" he added.
Brokers Canaccord and Liberum both said the announcement was ""unexpected"" and ""disappointing"" for Halfords, whose shares were 3% down on Wednesday.
Canaccord pointed out that it was the second time Halfords had lost a CEO to a ""bigger"" role at a rival.
Former Halfords' chief executive Matt Davies left to run Tesco's UK business in 2015.
Last month M&S revealed plans to shut six stores while opening 36 brand new ones over the next six months, creating more than 1,400 jobs.
The plans involve opening 200 new food-only stores, while selling clothing and homeware from 60 fewer stores.

Japan banned US beef imports in 2003 after the outbreak of mad cow disease. It restarted imports in 2006, but only from cattle less than 20 months of age.
US officials said the move was likely to boost US beef exports to Japan by ""hundreds of millions"" of dollars.
Ron Kirk, the US trade representative said the decision by Japan was ""great news for American ranchers and beef companies"".
Japan has also eased restrictions on beef imports from Canada, France and the Netherlands.
The new rules will take effect from 1 February.
Before the ban in 2003, Japan was one of the biggest markets for US beef exports.
However, the ban resulted in other beef exporting countries such as Australia increasing their presence in Japan.
Since the lifting of the ban in 2006, US firms have been trying to regain their share of the Japanese market.
They have achieved some success and US exports to Japan have been rising. However, shipments are yet to reach the levels seen before 2003.
""This move is an important step forward in paving the way toward greater export opportunities to one of our largest export markets,"" said J D Alexander, president of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association.
However, some analysts were sceptical about whether the easing of restrictions would have an immediate impact on US beef exports.

978,"Previously loyal supporters and critics alike are asking: Has the new Labour leader got a women problem?
It was an issue that first arose as the result of the Labour leadership election was announced on Saturday morning, when Corbyn and Tom Watson became the all-male team of leader and deputy leader of the party.
When the key appointments were announced to the shadow cabinet, the voices grew louder.
Shadow chancellor - man. Shadow foreign secretary - man. Shadow home secretary - man.
Late on Sunday night reporters waiting for more appointments heard first hand that the gender issue was being taken seriously in Team Corbyn.
As the BBC's Eleanor Garnier reported: ""Then, close to midnight, a new voice, we thought it could be Simon Fletcher: 'We're taking a fair amount of shit out there about women… let's make Angela… shadow first minister of State, like Mandelson, she can do PMQs… do the Angela bit now.""
Shortly afterwards Eagle, already the shadow business secretary, did indeed become Corbyn's defacto deputy.
By the time the full shadow cabinet was named on Monday lunchtime, Labour were able to trumpet the fact that more than half of their shadow cabinet was made up of women.
That fulfilled Corbyn's campaign pledge and is the first time any party has been able to make such a claim.
When he, and his new shadow chancellor John McDonnell were asked about the lack of women in top jobs, they had similar responses - that traditional views of what the great offices of state were was based on the days when Westminster had an Empire to rule.
Actually, they both said, education and health were the big priorities and the big jobs for them and they were both roles filled by women.
And yet that suggestion has failed to impress the commentators.
In the Daily Telegraph Dan Hodges writes: ""In a mere 48 hours, it has all disappeared - all that stuff about new principles and new values and a new beginning. Vanished into the night.""
In The Times, Rachel Sylvester writes: that ""for all the talk of a new kind of politics, Team Corbyn's patronising approach to women is a throwback to the 1970s"".
She continues: ""Although the leader's office insists the shadow cabinet as a whole is balanced, two of the female members have been appointed to entirely new positions, dealing with mental health and young people. It is as if Mr Corbyn's proposal for women-only carriages on trains has been transposed to Westminster, with female politicians given their own ""safe"" areas. For a party supposedly committed to equality it seems a surprising failure - but in keeping with the macho nature of traditional hard-left politics to which the new leader belongs.""
In the Guardian Rowena Mason reports Labour's previous Lords leader Lady Royall as saying: ""I applaud … [that] there will be equal numbers of men and women in the shadow cabinet. And maybe Jeremy does believe the shadow international development portfolio is as important as the Treasury. But the thing is the outside world does not think that. Maybe we can change the culture of our party, parliament and the country, but they are not [thinking that] at the moment.""
It is obviously an issue that Corbyn is keen to tackle - telling the TUC on Tuesday that the gender balance of his shadow cabinet was a sign of his new politics.
So how do his numbers add up?
The shadow cabinet announced by Labour includes 31 roles (including some which are not shadowing cabinet roles) of which 16 are held by women.
That compares with the current cabinet, which has seven women out of 22 members, and the then-record-breakingly diverse first Tony Blair cabinet of 1997 which had more than two women in it. ( there were five - see the full list here)
Ahead of the general election eleven members of Ed Miliband's 27-strong shadow cabinet were women.
On a more general note - across the House of Commons - there are 191 women, which is 29% of the total - the highest ever. (For more stats on women in Parliament and Government, try this House of Commons Library briefing paper)
Overall, those comparisons do not look too bad.
But, even allowing for those motivated by opposition to Corbyn, there's been a woman prime minister, a woman home secretary and, for a short period, a woman foreign secretary.
And until one of those roles - or shadow roles - is filled in Corbyn's team by a woman, then the gender question is likely to hang around.","The new Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has been criticized for having an all-male shadow cabinet. However, after the appointment of Angela Eagle as his defacto deputy, more than half of his shadow cabinet is made up of women.

The area had been mined by the Farc (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), the military said.
The left-wing group has been engaged in peace talks with government negotiators since November 2012, aimed at ending more than 50 years of conflict.
There has been agreement on several points and the negotiations continue to be held in the Cuban capital, Havana.
But there's been an escalation in violence and an increase in attacks against security forces since the end of the ceasefire, says the BBC's Natalio Cosoy in Bogota.
The Farc, which had declared a unilateral ceasefire in December, ambushed and killed 11 soldiers in May.
President Juan Manuel Santos responded by ordering the resumption of bombing raids on rebel positions.
Last week the Farc brought down an electricity pylon in Caqueta and cut off power to almost half a million people, according to the military.","The document reports on recent events in Colombia, including an attack on infrastructure in Catatumbo, a contamination of a river with oil from a pipeline, and the killing of four military personnel in an unrelated incident due to landmines.

991,"Gylfi Sigurdsson hit the bar as the Swans shaded a first half in which the visitors were denied a penalty for an apparent foul on Robert Snodgrass.
The hosts dominated possession after the break but Hull substitute Shaun Maloney struck from close range.
Abel Hernandez added a second in injury time to take the Tigers, still without a permanent manager, up to third.
Relive the match from the Liberty Stadium
Media playback is not supported on this device
Both teams were aiming for a second win from their first two league games - unexpectedly so in the case of Hull, whose opening victory over Leicester was the first time the reigning English champions had begun a title defence with defeat since 1989.
The feat was even more impressive as Hull achieved that with just 13 senior players at their disposal, as was the case at the Liberty Stadium.
His squad still ravaged by injury, caretaker manager Mike Phelan unsurprisingly stuck with the same team which beat Leicester.
And although Hull had to endure long spells of Swansea possession, they were dangerous on the counter-attack - thanks largely to the creativity of Snodgrass.
His neat through ball gave Adama Diomande a glorious chance to open the scoring - which he sliced wide - and the Scotland midfielder should have been awarded a penalty when he was brought down by Jordi Amat's rash sliding tackle shortly before half-time.
Snodgrass also played an important role in the first goal, as it was his corner which was turned in by the unmarked Maloney.
This was an underwhelming start to a new era for Swansea, with American owners Jason Levien and Steve Kaplan in attendance for the first time since completing their takeover in July.
Their vision for the club is built on sustainability and prudence, though their one substantial outlay so far - the £15m club-record signing Borja Baston - was missing through injury.

Despite monopolising possession and spending much time in Hull's half, Swansea lacked invention and purpose in attack.
One positive was the return of Sigurdsson, making his first start of the season having been given an extended rest following his impressive Euro 2016 campaign with Iceland.
Not even his creative nous could lift the Swans, however, as Francesco Guidolin's side limped to a first home defeat since February.
Hull caretaker manager Mike Phelan: ""We still are short on numbers and have to be realistic. It was a tremendous performance and the character of the group has been brilliant from day one.
""The difficulty to come here was to see if we could go after them or contain them. The players stuck to their task and we created more chances than them.""
Swansea boss Francesco Guidolin: ""I am disappointed. We did not deserve to lose today. We attacked for 90 minutes but not brilliantly. We have to play quicker but that is not easy against a compact team. It was a difficult game for us.""

Few have access to them or have even heard of them. Instead, Kaymu, whose website declares it the ""number one marketplace in emerging countries"", is rapidly cornering the market.
It is the brainchild of e-commerce group, Africa Internet Holding, backed by Rocket Internet, the incubator founded by the German Samwer brothers famous for making millions by cloning digital businesses.
Launched just two years ago Kaymu now has operations in 25 countries and 15 of them are in Africa.
While there are other e-commerce sites in Ivory Coast - such as Jumia, Africa's answer to Amazon, as well as Wasiri and Sigata - Kaymu is the first person-to-person marketplace open to individuals rather than just shops.
Its Ivory Coast operation launched at the start of this year, and many locals are beginning to cotton on to the potential benefits.
When I meet Fatoumata Guindo she is carefully unwrapping a package containing three ceramic cake moulds. She turns them over in her hands, inspecting them, and then moves on to a second package; more cake moulds in different shapes.
""This is the first time I've ordered anything online,"" she tells me. ""I'm not too into the internet, you see.""
Madame Guindo, in her 60s and the wife of the local imam, has just received her first order from Kaymu.
A little sceptical of buying anything at first, she now thinks e-commerce could be the future. ""Yes, it's possible. This can happen,"" she says.
In Abidjan, Ivory Coast's economic capital, Kaymu's country manager Mehdi Ben Abroug takes me to Adjame, the country's biggest market.
From fruit and veg, to jewellery, to washing machines, the tightly packed stalls sell absolutely everything. The smells, colours and sounds are so intense, a few hours of browsing leaves you exhausted.
It is where Kaymu first began to recruit its ""sellers"".
""These guys in this market have very low margins because they are wholesalers,"" explains Mr Abroug.
""They go to Dubai, to China and bring back containers and they sell as wholesalers so the margin on the product is really low.""
But on Kaymu, he says, they can sell directly to the customer and get a higher margin.
More than 200 market sellers in Adjame now have a presence on the e-commerce marketplace.
It works in the same way as eBay in that anyone can use the site to sell anything, so-called customer-to-customer.
Kaymu helps sellers post pictures of their products on the website, arranges collection and delivery of the goods, and takes 10-20% commission of every item sold.
Take-up of the new site has been faster in Ivory Coast than any other country on the continent.
Africa chief executive Elias Schulze explains that the country's ""tradition of private sector vibrancy"" and ""strong mobile and internet backbone"" has been a huge part of the company's success here.
He adds that ""the emerging middle class who are largely tech-savvy and hungry for real price and product discovery"" are ready to buy online.
Demba Barradji, 26, the manager of Barradji & Fils, a jewellery shop in Adjame, stands behind his counter as the Kaymu rep asks him to sign the forms for today's collection.
""I chose Kaymu for my business to grow,"" he says. ""[Profits] have already increased by around 20-25%. It's a good business for Africa and for Ivory Coast - a business that has a future.""
He pours the gold chains and glittery watches he bought in Thailand into the Kaymu pouches ready for delivery.
""To start with I didn't have much confidence in Kaymu because of cyber-criminality,"" he says. ""But now there hasn't been any problems or scams. It's OK.""
And would he close up shop and transfer everything online?
""Yes. Why not close my shop, as I will make more money,"" he says.
Up the road from Mr Barradji's shop, 27-year-old Abdul Affiz Jewar manages his family's cosmetics store, well-known in Adjame for its cheap beauty products.
He also joined Kaymu a few months ago but has not seen the same types of increase in profits. He puts this down to the fact that it is ""cheaper for my customers to buy things in the shop"".
Delivery costs of about $3 to $4 per item, make it hard for him to be competitive online.
""I can't imagine closing my shop and selling only online because I have lots of clients who I would lose,"" he concludes.
However, cyber crime is one of the major challenges facing e-commerce in Ivory Coast. The country has one of the worst reputations for cyber criminality on the continent, leaving many people wary of buying online.
""For the moment people are afraid,"" says Mr Barradji. ""But in the long run, in the future… it could be better.""
Cyber crime also poses problems for online payment, which is why everything is done cash-in-hand, for now at least.
The drivers call the customers in advance to arrange delivery and then collect payments when they deliver the goods.
But this will not be the case for long, insists Mr Abroug.
""We have huge expectations for mobile money,"" he says. Kaymu plans to pay vendors via mobile then expand this service to the customers buying online.
For now though, with no upfront payment, it is not unusual for delivery drivers to make wasted trips.
Often customers are not at home when they said they would be, don't have enough money, or have simply changed their minds.
Fewer than 50% of orders placed online end up in a payment.
So until better technology comes to the rescue, e-commerce in Ivory Coast can mean a day scooting around the city on the delivery bike in the tropical West African rains. All for nothing.","Kaymu, an e-commerce marketplace backed by Rocket Internet, is rapidly expanding in Africa. The platform allows individuals to sell and buy products directly, and has been particularly successful in Ivory Coast, where it has helped boost the local economy. Despite concerns about cyber crime, the company plans to expand its use of mobile money for payments.</s>",mistral7b,XSUM,

An Algerian man was arrested on Sunday over the alleged plan, after he apparently shot himself by accident and called an ambulance.

Ninety-seven of those had died in Syria or Iraq, including seven while carrying out suicide attacks, he added.

Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland ""stands in solidarity"" with the ""wonderful city"" of London.
A debate on independence, suspended as the attack unfolded, will resume at Holyrood next Tuesday.
The debate and a vote on Ms Sturgeon's plan to ask Westminster for permission for an independence referendum was halted on Wednesday afternoon following the terror attack in London that claimed the lives of four victims and the attacker.
Parliament officials met on Thursday morning and decided that the debate and vote would be rescheduled for 14:20 on Tuesday of next week.
Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh opened the Holyrood session by noting that he had sent a letter to Commons Speaker John Bercow and London Mayor Sadiq Khan conveying ""sympathy and sorrow"" and ""solidarity with fellow parliamentarians"".
Ms Sturgeon then made a statement expressing her ""shock and sadness at the heinous attack on Westminster"".
She endorsed the words of Prime Minister Theresa May, noting that ""we stand united in our core values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law - those values are strong, and they will endure"".
She added: ""We know that, at times like these, it can be all too easy to look for someone to blame. It is important therefore that we are very clear about this:
""Acts of terrorism are not the responsibility of any one faith or section of our society. The only people to blame for acts of terrorism are the individuals who plan and perpetrate them.""
Eight arrests have been made in raids following the attack.
Seven of the injured are still in hospital in a critical condition, while a further 29 had received hospital treatment.
The attacker, who was British-born and previously investigated by the security services, drove a car along a pavement in Westminster, knocking down pedestrians before stabbing a policeman after the vehicle crashed.
He was then shot dead by police in the grounds of parliament.
Holyrood's other party leaders also spoke out about the attack, in lieu of their normal questions on government policy.
Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the ""attack on our values"" had ""failed"", adding: ""Once again we express our gratitude to the police officers and security guards who at Westminster - and here at Holyrood - work to keep us safe, whose bravery we only truly appreciate at a time like this.
""People like PC Keith Palmer, who lost his life yesterday doing his job, doing his duty.
""The lesson here is not to tar one religion or one group in the coming days - but to tackle the evil of terrorist ideology itself. Not to vilify or blame whole communities, but instead to show we all stand united against terror, and stand united in defeating it.
Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale echoed this point, saying: ""No matter the religion, nationality or identity of the attacker, this cannot and must not turn into a war on any one community.
""Bringing people together must be part of the solution to tackling terror, rather than creating further division within communities.
""We must send a strong message that Britain remains an open and tolerant nation that is home to people of all faiths and nationalities.""
Scottish Green co-convener Patrick Harvie added his ""deep concern"" for all those affected by the attack, noting ""respect and gratitude to all those who stepped forward, both bystanders who helped the injured and the emergency services who showed professionalism and dedication"".
And Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie recounted that he would walk along the route where the attack unfolded on his way to work when he was an MP.
He said he wanted to be free to walk that route again, calling for a balanced response to the attack based on security and intelligence, but not fear.
Flags at the Scottish Parliament are flying at half mast as a mark of respect for the victims of the attack, and there has been an increased police presence in and around the parliament building.
Ms Sturgeon joined other MSPs for a minute's silence as the parliament opened on Thursday morning.
An email to MSPs, staff and Holyrood pass-holders from the Scottish Parliament chief executive's office said: ""While there is no intelligence to suggest there is a specific threat to Scotland, Edinburgh or Holyrood, we have increased security with immediate effect at the Scottish Parliament as a precaution.""
Parliament officials had initially refused requests to suspend Wednesday afternoon's debate after requests from politicians including Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson.
But Mr Macintosh later decided that news of the London attack was affecting the contributions of MSPs, and announced that the debate would resume at another time.
The decision was welcomed by Ms Sturgeon, but some MSPs - including Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham - were visibly angry at the decision. Ms Cunningham was later said to agree entirely with the suspension of the debate after learning the full details of the London attack.
However other MSPs, including Liberal Democrat Mike Rumbles, argued that halting the debate was effectively ""giving in to terrorism"".
Ms Sturgeon had been expected to win the backing of a majority of MSPs for her plan to ask the UK government for a section 30 order, which would be needed to hold a legally-binding referendum on independence.

Jurors heard on Tuesday he handed over keys to a farm workshop to officers investigating Georgina Symonds' disappearance.
""You will need those keys - she's locked in the outhouse,"" he is alleged to have told them.
The married father-of-two is accused of strangling Ms Symonds, 25, with orange baling twine in January after a three-year relationship.
The jury was told Mr Morgan said: ""I lurched across and put the rope around her neck. I pushed against her head and wrapped it around her neck, anticlockwise.""
He is accused of murdering the former burlesque dancer in the bungalow where she lived in the grounds of the castle he owned.
Jurors were told Mr Morgan killed the mother-of-one after discovering she planned to ""fleece him"", leave him and work for other men.
He overheard the conversation through a listening device disguised as a plug adapter which he planted in her home, a jury was told.
The prosecution said Mr Morgan called the listening device 514 times from November 2015 until Ms Symonds' death on 12 January 2016.
He allegedly stored the number for the device in his mobile phone as a contact called Isobel and rang the bug for up to two hours at a time.
The court heard Mr Morgan overheard a phone call between Ms Symonds and her new boyfriend Tom Ballinger, which took place at 22:25 GMT on 10 January 10.
She was heard on a recording saying she wanted him to sign over the property to her and then planned to ""fleece him"".
Prosecutor William Hughes QC told the jury Mr Morgan created a note on his phone at 03.20 the following morning, reading: ""SIM, gloves, snip, handle, tape, adapter.""
""It was a list showing he was preparing the murder of Georgina. It is a document of real significance,"" he said.
The court heard he murdered Ms Symonds in the house in which she lived rent-free on 12 January and Mr Morgan carried her body to a metal pole so he could carry her to his luxury Porsche.
He is then said to have driven her body 15 miles (24km) from Pencoed Castle, Llanmartin, to Beech Hill Farm, near Usk, and wrapped it in plastic.
Mr Hughes also said Mr Morgan made an ""unsolicited comment"" to police officers.
""He said calmly: 'I can't take it. I need to tell you I strangled her this morning'.""
Mr Hughes said police officers saw the plastic sheets when they searched the workshop.
""The officers were unable to see what was inside the sheeting so a small incision was made and once this had been undertaken the officers saw the feet of a human body,"" he told the court.
The trained beautician, from the Allt-yr-yn area of Newport, was being paid £7,000-£10,000 a month by Mr Morgan to work as his exclusive personal escort.
