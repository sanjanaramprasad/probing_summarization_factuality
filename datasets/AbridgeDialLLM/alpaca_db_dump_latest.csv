Michael: yes asap
Kai: for the Netherlands?
Michael: maybe to recharge and look for jobs abroad, but I don''t want to stay there. I know it’s not smart to quit without an alternative
Kai: depends on the field. I don''t know yours and your experience. But it can be a bit stressful also
Michael: true, in my field it wouldn’t be good. Anyway I need to speak to my manager and discuss because I’m not happy in my job now. How’s everything on your side? too much work?
