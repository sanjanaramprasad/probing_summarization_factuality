Really, he knows what I think and I know what he thinks so I don't bring up certain things. I don't want to argue, but if it keeps happening, I don't see the point of talking to him\r\nKate: I'm angry every single time I talk with him\r\nMary: Eh, I don't get why he keeps doing it. What did he say?\r\nKate: I don't want to get worked up over it again, but really usual stuff. He watched a programme about the refugees and went on a rant about it\r\nMary: oh god\r\nKate: right?! I don't know why I'm still talking with him. I tried to talk some sense into him, apparently with no luck\r\nMary: What did you tell him?\r\nKate: What I usually tell him. He was an immigrant once, he was working abroad, I sent him all the data and research, statistics, everything.\r\nMary: I'm afraid Chris may be too pig-headed for that\r\nKate: Pfff I bet he didn't even read anything. He's just watching the nationalists, Trump and all those idiots, listens to everything they're saying on the telly instead of just thinking for once\r\nMary: I know, to be honest I kind of avoid these subjects when I'm talking with him\r\nKate: Well, I try to as well, but as you can see he can't stop himself\r\nKate: I know he's our friend and we go out often, but I'm not sure I can do it any more, I don't want be friends with someone who thinks that Mexican children are worse and that they should be kept away from the US\r\nMary: Oh my god he said that?\r\nKate: Yes :/\r\nMary: Jesus, I knew he has strong views, but to say something like that? That's a bit too much\r\nKate: You're telling me this. I think we should reconsider this let's say friendship, because if every conversation will lead to something like this, I'm not interested in staying in touch with him\r\nMary: No wonder",
