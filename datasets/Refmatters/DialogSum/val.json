Frozen pizza are so bad for you!\n#Person2#: I know they aren't good for me, but they are cheap, convenient, and fairly tasty.\n#Person1#: I recently saw a piece for spicy chicken curry in a magadize. Maybe we could try that?\n#Person2#: yeah, why not. Do you have all the ingredients?\n#Person1#: I bought all the ingredients this morning, so let's start!\n#Person2#: what do we do first?\n#Person1#: first, you need to wash the vegetables and then chop them into little pieces.\n#Person2#: ok. Should I heat the wok?\n#Person1#: yes. Once it gets hot, put a little oil in it, add the vegetables and stir-fry them for a few minutes.\n#Person2#: what about the chicken?\n#Person1#: that needs to be cut into thin strips about 3 cm long and then it can be stir-fried on its own until its cooked through.\n#Person2#: how about the rice?\n#Person1#: I'll prepare it. Do you prefer white rice or brown rice?\n#Person2#: white rice, please. None of that healthy brown stuff for me!",

Well, how's it all going?\n#Person1#: Oh, not too bad, we're just about to open a branch in New Zealand. Oh! ... I'm hoping to--if I can justify it to the marketing director! How's your little boy, has he started school yet?\n#Person2#: Oh, yes, he's in the second year now.\n#Person1#: What, already? Doesn't time fly! Is he enjoying it?\n#Person2#: Very much, it's much more fun than being home!\n#Person1#: Haha. Well, I suppose we'd better make a start. Shall we get down to business?\n#Person2#: Right. First of all can I confirm the time and date of the presentation? It's Saturday 24 October in the morning. What time exactly?\n#Person1#: Well, on the invitations we've sent out we've said that the presentation itself will start at 11 and go on till 12:30.\n#Person2#: So you'll need the room from about 10 till 2. Would you like us to serve coffee beforehand?\n#Person1#: Yes, yes. Oh, and drinks and snacks at the end.\n#Person2#: Better to have buffet lunch?\n#Person1#: No, I... people who are invited won't be expecting a free lunch. They might think that's overdoing it. They'll want to get back to their families, as it's Saturday.\n#Person2#: All right, the normal pre-lunch snack buffet will be what you need--that's basically the same as what you had last February.\n#Person1#: Oh, that'll be fine.\n#Person2#: OK, well, we'll charge for the room, coffee and snack buffet at the standard rate less 15%, as we agreed. And we'll charge for the drinks served on a pro-rata basis.\n#Person1#: Free, fine, yes.\n#Person2#: What type of... um.., equipment, furniture would you like?\n#Person1#: Well, let's have.., um... four.., no, no... five tables for our display. Er... we'll bring our own stands. Now, there's an overhead projector and sound system already in the room, I believe? Can you get someone to check that before we come, you know, to see that it's working?\n#Person2#: Oh, of course, the technician will be with you when you're setting everything up. Oh, the seats in that room have flap-over desk tops, will that be all right?\n#Person1#: Yes, yes, that's fine, sure.\n#Person2#: You say you've sent out the invitations, any idea how many people there'll be? Urn... I think you know there's... the capacity for the room is about 50, but 40 is ideal.\n#Person1#: Yes, ah... the problem is that we won't know exactly how many there'll be until shortly before.\n#Person2#: Can you let me know definitely by Thursday?\n#Person1#: Mm... no. But I'll have a rough idea and we'll budget for the number I give you then. We've sent out 100 invitations...\n#Person2#: 100?!\n#Person1#: Yes, well, in theory that meant that there could be 200 people.\n#Person2#: Yes, but the room won't...\n#Person1#: But of course, haha... I don't expect more than about 30 to come.\n#Person2#: But what if they do? This room is the only one we have that day--there's a wedding reception in the banqueting rooms, so we...\n#Person1#: Well, in that case, I suppose...",

Isn't there a law against that, I think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages. You should know your rights! If you are putting in so many hours, they should give you some kind of compensation.\n#Person2#: They do give bonuses at the end of the year for the employees with highest productivity numbers, but frankly, it's not much of an incentive. They give us a bonus of ten dollars.\n#Person1#: That's just wrong! why don't you just quit?\n#Person2#: I would, but I'm afraid I would't be able to find another job. I don't have very many job marketable skills, there aren't so many jobs that I'm qualified for.\n#Person1#: it sounds like any job will be better than the one you have now!",

Is it because of the cold weather in Northern Europe?\n#Person2#: Not exactly. I have a lot of work to do next week.\n#Person1#: Well, I'm glad you won't be alone on a holiday. It'll be great to have you celebrate with us. The more the merrier!\n#Person2#: Exactly, how many people will be there?\n#Person1#: Let's see, my parents, my grandpa, my sister, my brother-in-law, my niece and my two cousins, plus us. So, ten people altogether.\n#Person2#: Should I bring anything?\n#Person1#: Nope, we've got it covered.\n#Person2#: Come on, I hate to show up empty-handed. You are being so generous to have me. I know! I'll bring pie. I'll make a great pumpkin pie.\n#Person1#: Sounds delicious, but my sister has already volunteered for dessert. Look, don't worry about it. There will be tons of food. Turkey, stuffing, green beans, sweet potatoes.\n#Person2#: Wow, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. How about this, I'll bring a nice bottle of wine.

If you remember, we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets. Now, when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals, there are three things to consider. First, the original condition of the market, second, our marketing numbers from the previous year, and third, our final sales figures for this year. Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts. If you look at the overhead, you'll see a graph... The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005, the red line is the sales in 2006... As you can see, our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with, but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year.

Look at my running shoes over there.\n#Person1#: Andrew. They're still in the box. \n#Person2#: Well ... \n#Person1#: Never used. Besides exercise, yeah, exercise is wonderful.

And, and you can't load up your plate with seconds and thirds like you always used to do at the family parties.\n#Person2#: Well, okay. I'll just get a bigger plate!\n#Person1#: Andrew! That won't help. Next \n#Person2#: Oh, next? \n#Person1#: . Oh yeah.

If you skip breakfast, then throughout the day, you feel like you need to make up it by overeating at lunch and dinner and lots of snacks.\n#Person2#: Uh ... \n#Person1#: Anyway, um, oh yeah. Don't eat late at night.\n#Person2#:  What? Like what?\n#Person1#:  Well, you know a lot of people ... they want a ... they want a late night snake and stuff like that, but a lot of times, that's really, really high-calorie stuff like ice cream and things, and your body's not active to burn it off, so you just store all those calories as fat.

All you eat is ice cream? Oh, oh, oh. Look in your trash. You go to McDonalds every day. Every day you're eating at fast food? \n#Person2#: Well ...\n#Person1#: Okay, you got to cut out the fast food. When you know the manger of McDonalds by name, and he's your best buddy on Facebook, you know that you're going to McDonalds or any fast food place too much.\n#Person2#: Uh, this is going to be tough.\n#Person1#: Yeah. It probably will be. But you also need to eat a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables. \n#Person2#:  Oh, well. \n#Person1#: cut way back on sugar. No more sugary drinks like those five gallons of Coke you drink every day.\n#Person2#: I don't drink five gallons.\n#Person1#: Close enough. Look at the size of those cups! How many times do you refill them?\n#Person2#: Well, then, drink what?\n#Person1#: Water!\n#Person2#: Water?\n#Person1#: It's really good for you.\n#Person2#: Oh, this is going to be tough.\n#Person1#: It might be.",

A New Yorker, eh? \n#Person3#: Born and raised in Brooklyn. Good to meet you, Pete. \n#Person2#: Brooklyn. . . that's a great neighborhood. I'm originally from Queens but moved down to Manhattan a while back. So. . . you're an expat in China. . . how's life over here working out for you? \n#Person3#: You know - I really love it. There are frustrations of course, such as traffic, pollution and the language barrier, but all in all, I give China a big thumbs up. \n#Person1#: Before you two get carried away in conversation, let's finalize our plans for the evening. I was thinking of dining at a well-known dumpling restaurant and then hitting a Karaoke bar for some fun! \n#Person2#: Everything sounded good until I heard the word 'Karaoke'. If there's one thing you don't want to hear, it's me singing. \n#Person3#: I sound like a frog that's suffering from a bad cold! But Karaoke is so popular in Asia that I've been dragged to at least two dozen of them so far. I've even learned a Chinese song or two. \n#Person1#: Hey. . . no Karaoke. . . no problem! We're here to have fun and if singing isn't fun. . . then forget it! I assume you like beer. \n#Person2#: Beer is quite possibly my very favorite liquid. \n#Person3#: Chinese beer is actually pretty good. I've sampled all of them so I should know! \n#Person1#: Great!
