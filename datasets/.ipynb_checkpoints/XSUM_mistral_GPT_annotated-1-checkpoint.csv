5,"Mourinho could not afford any mistakes in this third-round tie after Premier League defeats by Manchester City and Watford, with a Europa League loss to Feyenoord sandwiched in between.
It was eventually smooth passage, assisted by Northampton keeper Adam Smith, who endured a nightmare evening and played a big part in two of United's goals.
The highly rated 23-year-old picked up a back pass in the 17th minute and when Wayne Rooney's resulting free-kick was blocked, the recalled Michael Carrick fired home the loose ball emphatically.
Alex Revell gave the Cobblers hope of a shock from the penalty spot just before half-time after Daley Blind fouled Sam Hoskins - but this was not the night for an upset.
United regrouped and Ander Herrera's powerful drive put them in front after 68 minutes before Smith's misery was complete seven minutes later when he missed a simple long clearance to allow substitute Marcus Rashford to roll the ball into an empty net.
Relive Wednesday's EFL Cup action
Jose Mourinho has been reluctant to use the 35-year-old England midfield man since his arrival at Old Trafford. This was his first start since Manchester United's win against Leicester City in the Community Shield at Wembley.
On this evidence he surely has a strong case to force his way into Mourinho's plans - not least because he possesses the style and composure to bring the best from United's £89m world record signing Paul Pogba.
Pogba has looked restricted in his early performances and the selection of Carrick, so reliable in possession and even chipping in with a goal here, would allow the France midfield man freedom, play to his strengths and give him the opportunity to do damage further forward.
Carrick's experience and expert reading of the game adds to Mourinho's options and could finally bring the best from his showpiece summer signing. Surely he will start against Leicester City at Old Trafford on Saturday.
As Pogba got the night off and Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Rashford started on the bench with Mourinho making nine changes from United's 3-1 loss to Watford at Vicarage Road, there was no respite for Rooney.
United's embattled captain, who has bore the brunt of much of the criticism aimed at the side this season, was in the starting line-up but endured another night of frustration.
He worked hard but nothing is coming off for the 30-year-old. He missed one easy chance early on and when he did hit the target after Timothy Fosu-Mensah's header hit the bar, he was adjudged offside.
With Carrick and Herrera excelling and with a host of attacking options available to Mourinho, will Rooney's place come under threat against Leicester City at Old Trafford at the weekend?
Northampton may not have been able to spring the big shock and increase the woes for Mourinho by knocking Manchester United out of the EFL Cup - but there was still plenty for the club lying 11th in League One to be pleased about.
The neat Sixfields stadium was packed with a record crowd of 7,798. With a new stand in the process of being built, the club can be proud of the way it handled the big occasion.
Northampton's 31-game unbeaten run ended with defeat by Chesterfield on Saturday and for spells they showed United too much respect. This is, perhaps, understandable, but this was a night when Northampton as a club did itself great credit.
If there was a sadness, it was the disappointment suffered by keeper Smith, who has attracted Premier League attention but was badly at fault here.
Smith was included in the League Two team of the season as the Cobblers clinched the title in the previous campaign. There will be better days ahead for a talented young goalkeeper.
Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho: ""It was as difficult as I was expecting but we looked to be in control for the first 35 minutes and then we looked to be in control for the last 45. I think the team was in control from the beginning and the subs were just a contribution.
""The game should be easier, we should have been playing against 10 men very early in the second half. Northampton fought and they tried to cause us problems which sometimes they did but it was a positive performance overall.
""I don't like to individualise the players, I think it was fine, the midfield were in control.""
Northampton manager Rob Page: ""When you get back in to it at 1-1 you never know.
""I'm really proud of the players, we had to be disciplined. They've had a tough week by their standards but we knew we had to be strong. When you give away soft goals you will get punished.
""He (goalkeeper Adam Smith) was outstanding last season and he'll bounce back from this. He's a strong character, we've all had moments like that as players.""

It had two other ships on order for nearly £17m, using a loan from Santander bank.
But it ran into cash flow problems early this year as the oil price fell.
Administrators at PwC said the daily spot price for hiring offshore vessels dropped from £18,000 to only £3,000.
Prices reflected oil production firms cutting costs and exploration.
The administrators transferred Fletcher Shipping assets to a new company, FS Shipping, in a so-called 'pre-pack' deal.
This was financed with £18m, raised through Grovepoint Capital.
The main assets of Fletcher Shipping, founded in 2007, were the FS Pegasus, FS Aquarius, FS Pisces and FS Taurus.
The pre-pack deal means the operations continue uninterrupted, while shareholders lose out and creditors only recover some of their lending to the collapsed firm.
According to administrators, the transaction had no employment impact, as the vessels crews were contract staff working for other firms.
Keith Fletcher, founder of Fletcher Shipping, said: ""It is testament to the strong reputation of the crews and personnel at Fletcher Shipping that we have secured the confidence of new investors who have helped us recapitalise our business.
""We have worked hard to keep our fleet working throughout the recent downturn in the North Sea - a downturn which has affected the vessel market more harshly than I have witnessed in 30 years of business.
The Scottish Loan Fund is part of the Scottish Investment Bank, which is the investing arm of Scottish Enterprise, the Scottish government's economic development agency.
The loan fund is run by Maven Capital to meet gaps in the market for funding company growth.
Fletcher Shipping had a £5m investment from public funds over 2012 and 2013, as part of a consortium with the Royal Bank of Scotland and Maven Capital client funds.
At the time of announcing the funding package, the head of the Scottish Investment Bank, Kerry Sharp, said: ""Fletcher Shipping is exactly the kind of company the Scottish Loan Fund was established to support.

8,"However, a documentary called Tickled shines a spotlight on those who take part in it, when a TV reporter from New Zealand, David Farrier, uncovers not just a quirky sport, but a whole industry, and an underworld with allegations of cyber bullying.
Two years ago, Farrier, known for his ""and finally"" news pieces at his local TV station, discovered what was described as ""competitive endurance tickling"" videos online.
They featured young men in professional sportswear tickling each other.
A US-based company, Jane O'Brien Media, was producing the videos and offering substantial fees for anyone selected to take part in the shoots in Los Angeles.
""Right in the beginning I thought it was entirely innocent, perhaps with a subtext,"" explains Farrier.  ""I thought it was someone's idea of a funny strange sport, as it was in a photography studio, a professional space. All the men were wearing sportswear so I thought it was someone's odd idea of a tickling league.""
""I was intrigued and thought about doing a two-minute feature on it for my show, ""he adds, ""so I got in touch with them. Really, a short feature was all I was aiming for.""
In response however, Farrier, who is bisexual, says he received emails stating that the company did not want to deal with ""a homosexual journalist"".
""I was a little upset but part of me thought it was funny,"" he adds. ""I didn't understand why a company that makes men-only tickling videos would say that.""
""Instinct, intrigue and fascination"" drove him and his co-director Dylan Reeve on to find out more about the videos, despite representatives of the company flying to Auckland to threaten legal action. Farrier successfully raised the money for a documentary using the crowd-funding platform, Kickstarter.
""We probably did go into it quite naively,"" he believes.
""We never expected to find what we did. If you watch the film you'll find it's not really about tickling - it's about power.
""We were interested in the psychology of what made these men take part in the videos, and it was mainly guys who were athletes or military, and from poorer states.""
Although being tickled usually provokes laughter, science has long been interested in whether it's involuntary. Ten years ago, a study at the University of California at San Diego concluded that tickling did not necessarily produce pleasure, just the outward appearance of it.
Alan J Fridlund, a social and clinical psychologist, points out that whether it's enjoyable or not ""depends upon the social context of the tickle. Charles Darwin thought that infant tickling was the basis of adult humour and I agree"".
He added: ""But the insidious side of tickling is that if the tickler has a perverse motive, they will interpret the reflexive responses to tickling as a sign of approval, even when the social context turns dark.
""As the tickler proceeds, he or she is abetted by the nasty fact that strong tickling begins to cause cataplexy, a generalised weakening of the body's striate muscles, and one that many of us have known if we've been 'tickle tortured'. ""
That phrase is repeated by a participant of the tickling videos called TJ, who tells Farrier on camera that he was told taking part ""was for a project, as tickling was being considered as a military tactic for the army, tickle torture. I thought that was untrue"".
TJ says the reason he did it was ""because I was a little desperate for money. I was young at the time and I didn't think anything of it. I would get $2,000.
""On the day, I noticed it was all guys, and I didn't know I would get tied down, but there were athletes there, bodybuilders, a couple of actors I had seen on TV commercials - completely normal people. I still thought, 'I hope no one finds out about this'.""
In the documentary, TJ alleges that after the videos surfaced online, he asked them to be taken down, and was subjected to a campaign of abuse and harassment - including emails being sent to his employer at a high school.
The film claims others involved with making tickling videos have suffered controlling and abusive behaviour. However, Jane O'Brien Media strongly denies any wrongdoing.
The director confesses that his own viewpoint on tickling has shifted since making the film - and getting tickled himself for the purpose of making the documentary.
""There is pain in tickling, it's not always enjoyable. You're not laughing in the way you laugh as a joke. It can be used as torture and power play. There's also always one who is dominant, and one who is submissive. It's a metaphor for the power and control we talk about in the film.
""The innocence of it has gone for me - I don't tickle my nieces any more.""
The one word to sum up his experience, Farrier adds, is ""weird"".
""I was completely bemused a lot of the time about  what I was discovered. You couldn't actually make it up. Some people though think we have - they think it's so unbelievable that it's a spoof mockumentary.""

Durham and England seamer Mark Wood, 25, who only made his Test debut against New Zealand at Lord's in May, reflects on his achievement in taking the wicket that sealed his country's Ashes series victory against Australia at Trent Bridge on Saturday in just his fifth Test match.
Those are the moments you play the game for, the moments you dream about growing up. I just can't believe it was me.
There was a special atmosphere at Trent Bridge on Saturday. Every morning of a Test, they play 'Jerusalem' over the public address, but this is the first time I've ever known the crowd sing louder than the speakers.
I knew I would be bowling at the start because I had an over to complete from the night before, but captain Alastair Cook joked that unless I bowled four good balls I would be coming off.
The hairs were standing up on the back of my neck. I was thinking: ""I could win the Ashes for England here.""
The problem was that my Durham team-mate Ben Stokes kept bowling at the tailenders, leaving me to bowl at the established batsman Adam Voges. I had a bit of a laugh and joke with him, telling him ""no wonder you've got a six-for"".
Then Voges dug out a yorker and ran a single and I sensed I had a chance.
Australia number 10 Josh Hazlewood shows you a little bit of his stumps when he bats so I thought I'd bowl him a couple of shorter ones to let him know I was there and then have a go at the stumps. I got it exactly where I wanted and it bowled him.
Then came their number 11, Nathan Lyon, and the pressure was on. I could feel the crowd and the expectation. Stuart Broad kept shouting from mid-on that we were one ball away from winning the Ashes.
My first ball was too wide and the second was too straight. Come on Woody, get it right, I thought to myself. I went back to my mark and ran in. It was full and he couldn't get his bat out of the way in time. The ball hit the under-edge and shattered the stumps.
I jumped in the air and, as I turned, Jos Buttler grabbed me. Before I knew it we were all in a big huddle with me in the middle. People were shouting and screaming and I couldn't hear a thing. It was just manic.
When I got home my dad showed me the footage on TV and asked me what Cook was shouting to me but I told him I had no idea. It was that loud.
Eventually we broke away and Cook handed me, Stokesy and Joe Root a stump each. It was a brilliant gesture. He could easily have taken one for himself but he gave them to the young lads who had contributed to the win.
Once we got into the dressing room I thought I could let my emotions out a bit so I started hugging the team masseur and physio. Then I looked up and saw Sky Sports presenter Ian Ward lurking in the corner with a TV camera.
For a moment, I got a bit serious but when Ian Bell started giving an interview I couldn't resist standing behind him and dancing around. Then Rooty put on a mask and did his Bob Willis impression and we all just cracked up laughing.
The best moment of all was leaving the dressing room to do a lap of honour. I don't think I'll ever forget that. Just seeing what winning the Ashes meant to so many people was truly amazing.
When we were halfway round the field, Root and Cook came up to me and told me I had to bring out my imaginary horse, which has become my party piece when it gets boring in the field.
I've been keeping him in the stables all summer and I wasn't keen but they weren't taking no for an answer, so I checked the grass and let it fly for half a bend. I was a bit tired after my bowling spell so I think it was more of a trot than a gallop, but the crowd seemed to enjoy it.
We did some interviews on the field and everyone was a bit emotional. But when the skipper told that joke on the podium about how our coach Trevor Bayliss had only just turned up, it really lightened the mood.
Everyone could see what it meant to him, but to crack a gag at such a big moment really summed up our approach. We've wanted to have fun all series, to express ourselves and play exciting cricket.
Back in the dressing room, it was time for me to roll out the team song I'd been asked to write by Bayliss. He must think I'm either a lyrical genius or just that I have the best craic.
Either way, I spent a lot of time at Edgbaston and Trent Bridge working on it with Jimmy Anderson as my sidekick. We came up with some words for the lads to sing that seemed to go down pretty well and then we sang a special one for Broad because he was man of the match.
I can't reveal the lyrics of the songs... but maybe I will after The Oval.
We stayed in the dressing room until about 8.30pm singing songs and drinking. Being tee-total, I was on the water and orange juice but I still ended up with beer all over me.
Eventually we headed back to the hotel to spend a bit of time with our wives and girlfriends in the bar.
We were there until about midnight and then a few of the lads went out until the early hours. I won't name names, although I definitely heard Stokesy arriving back because his voice is very familiar.
He seemed to have forgotten his room key and was screaming at the door for his partner Claire to let him in. It went on for about half an hour so she was either in a deep sleep or wanted to teach him a lesson!
The reaction has been unbelievable. As well as the usual family members and friends, I've been getting texts and tweets from people I haven't heard from for years. Everyone seems to come out of the woodwork when something like this happens.
When I got home to Ashington in Northumberland on Sunday afternoon, I was expecting my parents to have put the bunting up, but they kept it low key. I've had a few people coming up to me to say well done, but it's been nice to relax and be myself.
I'll be seeing all my mates from the local cricket club on Tuesday. I can't wait to hear what they've got to say. No doubt they'll bring me straight back down to earth.
It will be nice to have a mental break and recharge the batteries before heading back down the M1 next Monday to join up with the squad and start preparing for the fifth Test at The Oval.
Australia will be up for the challenge. They will want to spoil the party and send captain Michael Clarke off into retirement with a big celebration, but we've got to make sure we don't give them a sniff.
Even if it means I'm made to gallop round the boundary on my imaginary horse belting out the team song, I'm desperate to win the series 4-1.

Watford's next manager will be their ninth in five years and the eighth since the Italian Pozzo family took over the club in 2012.
Chairman Scott Duxbury announced the latest exit after the board ""discussed goals and aspirations"" with Mazzarri.
""It was decided he will be stepping down from his position as the club's head coach,"" said Duxbury.
Monday's 4-3 defeat at champions Chelsea was their fifth loss in a row, although the Hornets avoided relegation and are six points above the drop zone with a game to play.

Chelsea striker Diego Costa and Baggies centre-back Gareth McAuley became embroiled in a tussle, and as referee Mike Jones tried to restore order, Fabregas kicked the ball at the group of players around the referee, hitting Brunt on the head.
The visitors competed well until half-time despite their numerical disadvantage, but the scale of their task was increased inside 30 seconds of the second half.

21,"Unlike many other homelessness initiatives, the so-called ""Housing First"" approach doesn't require homeless people to make steps towards solving other issues like alcoholism, mental health problems or drug addiction before they get accommodation.
Four experts talk to the BBC World Service Inquiry programme about how and why the approach works and some of its limitations.
Dr Sam Tsemberis is a clinical psychologist who founded Pathways to Housing in New York City in 1992, and developed the Housing First model.
""In the 1980s I was working at Bellevue Psychiatric Hospital on the east side of Manhattan, and I walked about 30 blocks to work.
""I began to walk past people that I recognised, people I had treated when I was working on the inpatient service at the hospital. They had gotten discharged, and were on the street, sometimes literally in the pyjamas that they had been discharged with from the hospital. It was quite disturbing.
""Many of them told me over and over again, 'I need a place to stay, a simple, decent, affordable place of my own like I had before I became homeless'.
""People had to participate in psychiatric treatment or be clean and sober in order to get housing. That was a precondition. And curing addiction or curing mental illness is still something we don't know how to do, and that was exactly what was being asked of people. It was an impossible hurdle to jump over.
""We began to do something that no-one had really done before, which was to take people on the street and offer them a place to live, no conditions other than sign the lease and pay your rent.
""The other breakthrough was to offer normal housing. We rented housing from community landlords on the open market, and people lived in apartments with families, older people, younger people, students, people of all types, including some people who had just the day before been homeless, but were homeless no longer.
""In that first year we had 50 people. The rule-of-thumb in most treatment programmes is a third do better, a third do worse and a third stay the same.
""At the end of the first year 84% were still housed: 84% of people who had been on the street for years. We knew we were onto something very important.
""At first it was misunderstood, and I think people were very uncomfortable because they thought of it as enabling something that should be earned, but if you back up from moral judgments, homeless people are already suffering and providing them with a house actually gets us much closer to the goal that we all want.
""We all want people off the streets and living a productive, meaningful life. This is just a much quicker, more effective and cost-saving way of getting to exactly that goal.""
Former music executive Philip Mangano was inspired to start helping homeless people after watching a film about St Francis of Assisi. He left his job to volunteer at his local church. Twenty years later he was appointed President George W Bush's homelessness czar, where he came across Sam Tsemberis' work.
""We had some very good research that indicated that a certain portion [20%] of homeless people were experiencing what was termed 'chronic' homelessness; they were homeless for a year or more and had a disability or concurring disabilities. So as a policy decision in Washington, we decided that we would focus specifically on that population of homeless people.
""I heard about a guy in New York who was placing people directly into housing off the streets and frankly, I was completely agnostic that that could be done, but I thought if that works, we better know about it.
""He took me to a number of people that had been housed, and it looked as though Sam had uncovered something that was in a blind spot for the entire issue for a quarter of a century. So I was interested in the tangible aspects of it, but I really wanted to look at the data. Was there confirming data and research that indicated that this approach worked? Yes there was. So I was a convert to Housing First.
""One of the key questions became how can we possibly afford housing for all these people?
""How much did homeless people cost when they were randomly ricocheting through very expensive health and law enforcement systems, the emergency room of the hospital, police interventions, court costs, and incarceration costs? How much did that cost, versus how much did it cost for people when they were placed in housing?
""Every single study we did revealed that it was less costly to provide the housing and the services than it was to have those people randomly ricocheting in expensive health and law enforcement systems.
""So you could spend up to $150,000 (£103,000) enabling a person to be homeless because you're not providing them with the solution. Or you could invest up to $25,000 (£17,000) and people would be in housing, stable, secure and safe [with] hardly any police interventions or utilisation of emergency rooms. You didn't need to be Warren Buffet to figure out which of those was the better investment.
""More than 1,000 communities got involved from around the United States, and we set the goal that we could end chronic homelessness - the homelessness of the most vulnerable, the most disabled, the most likely to die on the street. We could end that form of homelessness in our country in 10 years.
""We saw in the first five years about a 40% decrease in chronic homelessness around the country. Some cities achieved 67-70% decreases.
""But at this point, right now, I can think of only a couple of cities in the country that have actually ended chronic homelessness. The recession hit; administrations changed. Some of the attention got dissipated. That led to resources being dissipated. You didn't have that same concentration and so you didn't have the same outcomes and results.
Dr Josh Bamberger is the former medical director of housing, San Francisco, and implemented Housing First in the city, providing homes to more than 10,000 homeless people, mainly in an area called the Tenderloin.
""Like every other city in the United States, we had a ten-year plan to end homelessness and, as I'm sure you're aware, homelessness still exists in San Francisco.
""It's disappointing that it doesn't really feel like there's been much shift in the number of people who are lying on the streets in the Tenderloin, which is the inner-city portion of San Francisco, in 15 years.
""The Tenderloin is a densely-populated area. They're small apartments, 300 square feet, sometimes the bathrooms are down the hall. There are probably 1,000 or 1,500 of these buildings with 150 small apartments in them. It's loud, there's a lot of activity going on and there's a lot of drug dealing that goes on in the streets,
""I think if you're struggling with sobriety and people are offering you drugs and alcohol on a regular basis, it's harder to make progress.
""In San Francisco, we are in this very challenging conundrum where the cost to rent an apartment is beyond the means of low-income people. The average cost of a studio apartment in San Francisco is something like $2,500 a month (£1,700) and if you're getting benefits from the government, the most you can make is about $950 (£650) a month, so that's a huge gap that is never going to be overcome.
""We housed the wrong people. When you have such great demand for limited resources, then you need to be very exact and very courageous in only offering housing to the people who need it the most. We used our very limited local resources for people who are just low-income. We didn't focus on the highest users of the healthcare system first.
""What we should have done from the beginning is only offered housing to the 20% of people who are chronically homeless, and then used that opportunity to disclose that the government isn't investing in expanding the affordable housing sector adequately.""
Jamie Rogers ran the Housing First programme in the Canadian city of Medicine Hat, which has eradicated all homelessness, defined as meaning no-one will have to sleep rough for more than 10 days before they have access to stable housing.
""Medicine Hat is in South Eastern Alberta, a community of about 63,000 people. It's a very family-focused community.
""I first heard about Housing First from a trip that I took to Toronto. I have to be really honest: I was probably one of the biggest sceptics that it would actually work.
""Since April 2009, this community has collectively housed 1,013 individuals; 705 adults and 308 children.
""We take an extremely targeted approach to look at those that are in greatest need or closest to death, which typically are those who are chronically homeless, and are living in places that are unfit for human habitation.
""We did not have to build housing per se. We have a very limited number of units strictly for housing the homeless. What we do very well is build relationships with landlords and property management and communities, and use market housing.
""[Initially] landlords were extremely sceptical. They were worried about bed bugs, increased violence and drug dealing, so we worked really hard to present factual information about who we actually serve. And we've seen progress. We have 175 different landlord and property management companies on board with us and we now have landlords calling us.
""If you ended up on the streets of Medicine Hat tonight, you could spend one night in the shelter and be speaking to a worker within three days. And you could be on a wait list for a house as quick as tomorrow.
""Rather than just introducing programmes like Housing First, we have restructured our entire system approach to ending homelessness.
""We take the stance that people are worthy of a home and it is a fundamental human right to have shelter and a roof over one's head. Of course it is recovery-oriented, and we help and support people in making different choices in their life, but we don't withhold housing because of who they choose to be.
""Housing First works. I cannot say it enough: it absolutely works.""
The Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 12:05 GMT. Listen online or download the podcast.","The Housing First approach to homelessness is a model that provides people experiencing homelessness with immediate access to safe and affordable housing, without requiring them to address other issues such as addiction or mental health problems first.

Newport move seven points clear of the drop zone, while Luton drop to 13th.

""We never managed the game very well from that first goal on. We managed the game brilliantly before that, in really difficult conditions for both teams. Up until they scored I thought if anybody would win, it would be us.
""Individual errors are giving us problems at the moment. That's how it is, there's nothing I can do about it now. We can only get back on the training ground but it's hard to irradiate an individual error.
""This is football. You have to get back on the horse. There's no remedy or quick fix. You've got to make the most of your opportunities which we haven't done. These last few games have been bitterly disappointing.""

23,"Earlier this summer, I made a trip back to Benghazi, Libya's second city, ahead of the country's first post-Gaddafi nationwide elections.
There had been a spike of pre-election violence, especially in the east, and many Libyans were accusing a shadowy fundamentalist group that had emerged in the city that spawned the uprising against Col Muammar Gaddafi.
There had been an attack against a vehicle convoy carrying the British ambassador. There was a similar incident involving the UN's envoy to the country and even the Benghazi base of the International Committee of the Red Cross came under fire.
Most strikingly, video had emerged on the internet of a small group of young men desecrating and destroying Allied war graves in Benghazi's two Commonwealth war cemeteries.
Less high-profile incidents had also taken place across the city - among them, a drive-by shooting at a western-style hairdressing salon and anti-democracy protests in the main square.
We tracked down and arranged a meeting with Ansar al-Sharia members in a run-down area of central Benghazi, just off a small park where other men passed the day drinking coffee.
Unfortunately the group had made it clear they were not willing to be interviewed on tape, nor would they speak to female members of our team.
I met about four men in a sparsely furnished room on the fourth floor of a tower block. One middle-aged man, who called himself ""the Sheikh"", did most of the talking while four much younger men sat and listened.
While they seemed to care little for explaining their philosophy or methods to western journalists, they did not deny involvement in anti-democratic stunts.
As for the attacks on Western targets, they said they did not know who the perpetrators were, but alleged that ""Western intelligence agencies"" based in Libya were to blame because they wanted to undermine Sharia, Islamic law.
Did Ansar al-Sharia carry out Libya attack?
In a written statement, the group also told us why they rejected the electoral process then taking place across the country - even though Col Gaddafi, who had like many other Middle Eastern dictators suppressed the activities of Islamist groups, was dead and they were again free to organise.
""Democracy is a human condition where laws are made by people,"" said a brief statement from the Ansar al-Sharia group, on headed notepaper that contained the twin symbols of the Koran and a Kalashnikov rifle.
It went on: ""Only God has the authority to make law and that is why Islam and Sharia are incompatible with democracy.""
I never got the impression from my time in Benghazi or elsewhere in Libya that Ansar al-Sharia, and other extreme Islamist organisations, were large in number or particularly well supported.
Indeed, they were pretty much routed in the elections that returned a moderate Muslim Congress.
But as the terrible events of this week showed in Benghazi, with so many weapons at large in Libya and so much anger to tap into, even small organisations like Ansar al-Sharia could yet undermine the new, democratic Libya and its relationship with its Western supporters.","The article describes the author's trip to Benghazi, Libya ahead of the country's first post-Gaddafi nationwide elections.

People living in 10 houses on the road were ordered to leave last week over fears a landslip could cause the properties to collapse.
But many residents have said they are scared and ""in the dark"" about the future of their homes.
The council said eight of the 10 affected properties have been vacated, with families either moving or having moved into alternative accommodation.
But one tenant is said to be appealing a notice served on their home.
The local authority said ""no family will be left in B&B or other emergency accommodation.""
Thousands of tonnes of rock, soil and trees first slipped down the hillside behind the houses in 2012, with a further two landslides this year, causing some gardens to drop away.

""If there was a simple solution to dealing with landslips it would have been found long ago,"" the council said.

Northern Ireland shaded much of the game and largely snuffed out Wales' attacking threat, but they also lacked a cutting edge in attack.
Wales only managed one shot on target and the game was settled by the one moment of real quality at Parc des Princes.
Northern Ireland's resistance was finally broken when centre-back McAuley turned Gareth Bale's low, whipped cross into his own net.
It means Wales - in their first major tournament finals since the 1958 World Cup - will face Belgium or Hungary in the last eight in Lille on Friday.
Chris Coleman's side were blunted by their dogged opponents, but the scrappy nature of victory and the winning goal will matter little to their jubilant fans.
For Northern Ireland, the manner of defeat was galling, particularly for the 63-cap McAuley, who had scored in the 2-0 group win against Ukraine, which had helped his country reach the round of 16.
Both sides were playing a first match in the knockout stages of a major tournament since 1958, when they reached the World Cup quarter-finals.
Parc des Princes was awash with green and red as fans mingled and revelled in the enormity of the occasion - but the match failed to ignite during a cagey first half.
Northern Ireland's intention to frustrate their opponents was clear, depriving Wales of space with a careful pressing game held together by rigid positional discipline.
They also posed a counter-attacking threat, with one early break leading to a chance for Stuart Dallas, whose shot was saved by Wayne Hennessey.
Having beaten Russia so impressively in their final group game, Wales seemed neutered by Northern Ireland's containing strategy.
Coleman's men had struggled for goals during qualifying - scoring 11 in 10 matches - and this match demonstrated their occasional shortcomings against well-organised defences.
Bale saw one of his trademark dipping free-kicks saved by Michael McGovern but the Real Madrid forward's threat in open play was subdued.
That was until the 75th minute, when he unleashed a fizzing ball across the six-yard box and the sliding McAuley deflected the ball into the net.
This was the first match of the competition in which Bale failed to score, but his major contribution to Wales' winner was yet another example of the 26-year-old's ability to rise to the biggest occasions.
Tempers boiled over as Northern Ireland chased a late equaliser, with manager Michael O'Neill furiously animated on the touchline as he accused Wales of time-wasting.
Ashley Williams and Jonny Williams both received treatment on the pitch after colliding into each other, with the former holding his arm afterwards in a way which he suggested he may have broken or fractured part of it.
There was a heated exchange between O'Neill and Williams, with the Northern Ireland boss later claiming Wales coaches on the bench had told their captain to sit on the pitch to waste time.
The Swansea City centre-back stayed on the field until the final whistle but, with his arm in a sling afterwards, he could be a doubt for Wales' quarter-final on Friday.
Wales manager Chris Coleman on BBC One: ""The good thing about these boys when we're not playing well is that they have spirit. And at times we were hanging on.

""I'd rather be standing here in the quarter-final not playing at our best. We have to give credit to Northern Ireland - they made it very difficult to play against. They were the better team.

In a statement, Walmart said it felt the ""actions were legal and justified"" and that it would pursue other options to defend the company.
A group supporting the employees called the decision a ""huge victory"".
Most of the allegations filed by employees related to protests in 2013, when Walmart workers - backed by labour groups - travelled to the company's headquarters to protest at a shareholder meeting.
Walmart had said the employees were fired due to unexcused absences not protected by labour law.
The judge disagreed and ordered Walmart to compensate the workers for ""loss of earnings and other benefits suffered as a result of the discrimination against them"".
He also ordered Wal-Mart to hold a meeting in 29 stores throughout the country to inform employees of their right to strike, and to promise not to threaten or discipline employees for doing so.
Walmart has faced mounting protests over the last several years targeting its employee pay, the ability of workers to organise into a union and working conditions.

27,"Mr Woolfe was taken to hospital on Thursday after an altercation at the European Parliament in Strasbourg following a meeting of UKIP members.
Fellow UKIP MEP Mike Hookem has tweeted a photo of his ""unbruised"" hands, saying he did not punch Mr Woolfe.
The fracas is being investigated both by the party and the parliament.
Conservative MEP Sajjad Karim will lead the parliamentary probe.
Mr Woolfe collapsed after his exchange with Mr Hookem and was taken to hospital.
He had a precautionary scan which revealed there was no blood clot on his brain. He remains under observation in hospital ""as a precaution"".
The 49-year-old is among the favourites to be the party's next leader following the resignation of Diane James just 18 days after she was elected to the role.
Mr Woolfe's spokesman said on Saturday: ""A team of experts independent of the hospital staff were called in to examine physical injuries to Steven's face, head and body that were inconsistent with just a seizure, or a fall as a result of a seizure.
""The team of experts also examined other pieces of evidence including clothing and images relating to those injuries.
""Their report will shine a different light on claims currently being made in the media.""
Analysis: Where did it all go wrong for UKIP?
In response, Mr Hookem released the photo of his hands, asking: ""Can you see any bruising or abrasions?""
In an interview with BBC Radio Humberside on Friday, Mr Hookem acknowledged the pair had had a ""scuffle"".
But, he added: ""I am innocent. I never threw a punch. I never assaulted him. I will stand my corner.""
There have been varying descriptions of what happened and Mr Hookem has said only that he and Mr Woolfe knew precisely what went on.
Mr Woolfe objected to remarks which he made, he said. ""He then stood up in front of everybody and said 'if it's that, let's take it outside of the room', I think his words were 'mano a mano'.""
""When I walked in he approached me to attack me. He came at me, I defended myself.
""There were no punches thrown, there was no face slapping, there were no digs, there was nothing.""
""It's (what) people in Hull would term 'handbags at dawn'. A bit of a scuffle.""
Mr Woolfe has not spoken in public about the episode, but the Daily Mail quoted him as saying Mr Hookem ""came at me and landed a blow"" after they left the meeting room.
Another UKIP MEP, Nathan Gill, said there had been no police involvement and Mr Woolfe did not want any police involvement.

The BBC has been told he swore in frustration at the situation.
Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said Mr Mitchell should not lose his job over the use of ""inappropriate words"".
Cabinet minister Ken Clarke has also defended Mr Mitchell, who he said was a reasonable and courteous man.
The row broke out on Wednesday after Mr Mitchell was told by officers to get off his bicycle as he left Downing Street and go through the smaller pedestrian gate.
Soon afterwards, the MP for Sutton Coldfield said he did not accept ""that I used any of the words that have been reported"" - but did not go into specific details.
Meanwhile, a friend of Mr Mitchell, quoted by the Sunday Telegraph, says the minister was frustrated by the row, and admits he ""lost it a bit"" but was ""not accusing anyone of lying"".
The friend added: ""He realises there may be differing versions of what was said but he is adamant he did not use the words he is reported to have used.""
Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics programme, Mr Pickles said he believed his cabinet colleague used ""ungentlemanly"" and ""ungallant"" language.
Who says 'pleb' nowadays?
But he added: ""I don't believe somebody should lose public office merely because they used inappropriate words and displayed a bad temper.""
The communities secretary refused to say whether Mr Mitchell should resign if he used the word ""pleb"", but said ""he has never used it in my presence, but I'm proud to be a pleb"".
On Saturday, Mr Clarke, a minister without portfolio in the cabinet, said: ""I have known Andrew for a long time and he is a perfectly reasonable, courteous man with the same high regard for the police services as anyone else.
""He obviously had a flare of bad temper on this occasion and has rightly apologised. I do think this should be allowed to set the matter at rest.""
Yvette Cooper, shadow home secretary, has called for the government to release in full what Mr Mitchell said to the police officers and for an investigation into the incident.
In a letter to Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, Ms Cooper wrote that Mr Mitchell's behaviour was ""completely unacceptable"" and that ""a half-hearted private apology is clearly insufficient"".
""Everyone is already deeply concerned that a senior cabinet minister is reported as dismissing police officers doing an important security job as 'plebs',"" she wrote.
""It is really important that the prime minister does not compound this by dismissing the testimony of police officers and the evidence from their notebooks without proper investigation.""
The Liberal Democrat president, Tim Farron, described Mr Mitchell's alleged outburst as ""utterly, indeed beyond, unacceptable"".
His party leader, Nick Clegg, told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme it was right for Mr Mitchell to apologise, but argued it was time to ""draw a line under it"" unless more information emerged about the incident.
""I think civility and being courteous to the police is important at all times, but it is especially important given the tragic events around the killing of PCs Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes.
""What Andrew Mitchell did was wrong, very wrong.  He knows that and has apologised to the police and explained himself,"" Mr Clegg said.

Her friend, Julie Robinson, escaped with minor injuries.
Bradford Coroner's Court heard the exact details of the crash were unclear due to conflicting witness accounts.
Coroner Martin Fleming said the driver of the Toyota pick-up truck, Natthaphon Klomkhan, told police he was driving at approximately 60kph (37.5mph) when the moped drove from a side road, across a four-lane carriageway, and directly in front of his vehicle.
Mr Klomkhan said he braked, sounded his horn and flashed his lights but was unable to avoid hitting the bike.
Ms Robinson, who did not attend the inquest, said she checked before driving across the road, and claimed the truck was being driven at excessive speeds, and had failed to take evasive action.
In an email sent by Ms Robinson to the coroner in July, she said: ""He just drove straight into the back of the scooter, sending both of us flying through the air at some height.""
Describing the aftermath of the crash, Ms Robinson described blood pouring out of her friend's mouth when her head hit a metal barrier.
She was twice resuscitated at the scene but died later in hospital, the inquest heard.
Mr Fleming said photographs of the scene showed Ms Robinson's view would have been obscured and that crossing the carriageway would have left little margin for error.
He said it was unclear whether the truck driver was going too fast.
The inquest also heard police in Thailand had considered charging Ms Robinson in connection with the incident.

The Bears then replied with 325 to lose by 26 runs in the penultimate over.
Rikki Clarke (76) and Tim Ambrose (68) weighed in with half-centuries, while Keith Barker and Hannon-Dalby gave their side hope at the end with some lusty blows in a 27-run last-wicket stand.

Croft slammed eight sixes and eight fours, while England Test opener Haseeb Hameed also twice cleared the ropes in his 48.
Native Lancastrian Barker came in for unusually rough treatment, his nine overs going for 86, while youngster Aaron Thomason went for 32 off three overs and Hannon-Dalby 77 from eight overs.

34,"Greeks have been enthralled for months by the mystery surrounding the Amphipolis monument.
Now Katerina Peristeri has revealed that fragmentary inscriptions link the tomb to Hephaestion.
Hephaestion died less than a year before the Macedonian leader.
After his death in 325BC, Alexander was said to have ordered that shrines be constructed throughout the empire.
Ms Peristeri's team believe the site at Amphipolis may have been designed by one of two architects, Dinocrates or Stesicrates, and built by Antigonus, another of Alexander's generals.
They also believe that tiny inscriptions found at the site show Hephaestion's monogram (two initials from his name).
However, not everyone was convinced by the team's revelations.
Prof Panayiotis Faklaris of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki told Greek radio on Thursday that there was no indication that the tomb had any connection to Hephaestion or that Alexander had ordered it to be constructed.
There had earlier been speculation that the tomb may be linked to Alexander the Great's mother Olympias or his wife Roxana.
And earlier this year bones were recovered at the site that belonged to at least five individuals, including an elderly woman, a newborn child and two men, one of whom had been stabbed.
As well as 550 fragments of bone, animal as well as human, archaeologists have uncovered three vaulted chambers behind a facade decorated with two big marble sphinxes.
Within the chambers were a pair of caryatids - larger-than-life statues of young women -  and a mosaic pavement depicting the abduction of the goddess Persephone by Hades, king of the underworld.
Alexander, who built an empire from modern Greece to India, was buried in Egypt although the precise location remains a mystery.
As his generals fought over his legacy, his mother, widow, son and half brother were all killed, most of them near Amphipolis.

But he said he would not be resigning as senator until he had legal advice.
Under Australia's constitution, a person cannot run for federal office if they hold dual or plural citizenship.
Earlier this month, two senators from the Australian Greens party were forced to resign for holding dual citizenship.
In a statement posted on Twitter on Tuesday, Mr Canavan said: ""In 2006, my mother lodged documents with the Italian consulate in Brisbane to become an Italian citizen.

The politician - who was born in Australia and says he has never been to Italy - said that ""given uncertainty raised by this matter"" he was resigning as minister.
But he stressed that he was not quitting as senator because he had not yet obtained ""definitive legal advice as to whether my registration as an Italian citizen, without my knowledge or consent, was valid under Italian law"".

Both sides will be called to give evidence to Holyrood's devolution committee on that date.
Mr Swinney and Mr Hands hope a deal can be struck this week.
However, both men have said the onus is on the other to give some ground.
Ahead of the meeting, Mr Swinney said he remained ""committed to reaching an agreement that is in line with the principles of the Smith Commission"".
He said: ""For both parliaments to have adequate time to scrutinise an agreement, it is important that we make progress.""
No deal. No further devolution. Holyrood can't take on extra tax and welfare powers unless there's a fiscal framework to underpin them.
Any framework will include a system to reduce the grant Holyrood gets from the Treasury, to reflect its growing ability to raise its own revenue.
The two sides are struggling to agree the fairest way to achieve that. The Scottish government says the Treasury's current offer would leave it out of pocket. The Treasury disputes that and says SNP ministers can't expect taxpayers in the rest of the UK to underwrite all the risks that come with extra responsibilities.
The Scotland Office minister, Lord Dunlop, says the UK government is ""committed to go the extra mile to get a deal"". But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she ""will not sign up to a deal that's unfair to Scotland"".
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has written to Prime Minister David Cameron calling for him to step in over the matter.
He has said that ""no one is keener"" than he is to reach an agreement, but also warned the Scottish government would have to be ready to ""move towards"" his position.
Despite months of talks, the deadline for agreement was pushed back earlier this month.
On Wednesday, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson proposed a compromise that would see both sides give some ground to agree a shorter-term deal that would be reviewed in five years.
Earlier this week, Mr Hands was criticised for being on holiday with his family while negotiations were taking place.
A Treasury spokeswoman has said the UK government had shown it was willing to compromise and ""go the extra mile"" to secure an agreement.
The two sides differ on key parts of the deal, in particular their interpretation of the ""no detriment"" principle called for by the Smith Commission on further powers for Scotland.
This means neither the Scottish or UK budgets should be left worse off in future by the finalised agreement.
The Scottish government claims the Treasury's latest offer would amount to an ""almost Â£3bn cut"", while Mr Hands insists an offer tabled by Mr Swinney is ""not logical"" and ""not fair"" to taxpayers across the rest of the UK.
The deal proposed by Ms Davidson would see both parties give some ground.
She wants the Scottish government to agree to the UK government's new method of calculating the amount of money it receives each year from the Treasury.

42,"It warns that if someone contracts gonorrhoea, it is now much harder to treat, and in some cases impossible.
The sexually transmitted infection is rapidly developing resistance to antibiotics.
Experts said the situation was ""fairly grim"" with few new drugs on the horizon.
About 78 million people pick up the STI each year and it can cause infertility.
The World Health Organization analysed data from 77 countries which showed gonorrhoea's resistance to antibiotics was widespread.
Dr Teodora Wi, from the WHO, said there had even been three cases - in Japan, France and Spain - where the infection was completely untreatable.
She said: ""Gonorrhoea is a very smart bug, every time you introduce a new class of antibiotics to treat gonorrhoea, the bug becomes resistant.""
Worryingly, the vast majority of gonorrhoea infections are in poor countries where resistance is harder to detect.
""These cases may just be the tip of the iceberg,"" she added.
Gonorrhoea can infect the genitals, rectum and throat, but it is the last that is most concerning health officials.
Dr Wi said antibiotics could lead to bacteria in the back of the throat, including relatives of gonorrhoea, developing resistance.
She said: ""When you use antibiotics to treat infections like a normal sore throat, this mixes with the Neisseria species in your throat and this results in resistance.""
Thrusting gonorrhoea bacteria into this environment through oral sex can lead to super-gonorrhoea.
""In the US, resistance [to an antibiotic] came from men having sex with men because of pharyngeal infection,"" she added.
A decline in condom use, which had soared because of fears of HIV/Aids, is thought to help the infection spread.
The disease is caused by the bacterium called Neisseria gonorrhoea.
The infection is spread by unprotected vaginal, oral and anal sex.
Symptoms can include a thick green or yellow discharge from sexual organs, pain when urinating and bleeding between periods.
However, of those infected, about one in 10 heterosexual men and more than three-quarters of women, and gay men, have no easily recognisable symptoms.
Untreated infection can lead to infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease and can be passed on to a child during pregnancy.
The World Health Organization is calling on countries to monitor the spread of resistant gonorrhoea and to invest in new drugs.
Dr Manica Balasegaram, from the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership, said: ""The situation is fairly grim.
""There are only three drug candidates in the entire drug [development] pipeline and no guarantee any will make it out.""
But ultimately, the WHO said vaccines would be needed to stop gonorrhoea.
Prof Richard Stabler, from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: ""Ever since the introduction of penicillin, hailed as a reliable and quick cure, gonorrhoea has developed resistance to all therapeutic antibiotics.
""In the past 15 years therapy has had to change three times following increasing rates of resistance worldwide.
""We are now at a point where we are using the drugs of last resort, but there are worrying signs as treatment failure due to resistant strains has been documented.""

It's hard to say if more people around the world are having more oral sex than they used to, as there isn't much reliable global data available.
Data from the UK and US show it's very common, and has been for years, including among teenagers.
The UK's first National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles, carried out in 1990-1991, found 69.7% of men and 65.6% of women had given oral sex to, or received it from, a partner of the opposite sex in the previous year.
By the time of the second survey during 1999-2001, this had increased to 77.9% for men and 76.8% for women, but hasn't changed much since.
A national survey in the US, meanwhile, has found about two-thirds of 15-24 year olds have ever had oral sex.
Dr Mark Lawton from the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said people with gonorrhoea in the throat would be unlikely to realise it and thus be more likely to pass it on via oral sex.
He recognises that while condoms would reduce the risk of transmission, many people wouldn't want to use them.
""My message would be to get tested so at least if you've got it you know about it,"" Dr Lawton said.","The document warns that gonorrhoea, a sexually transmitted infection, is rapidly developing resistance to antibiotics, making it harder to treat.

48,"The deal, which shores up Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's one-seat majority in parliament, will see Mr Lieberman appointed defence minister.
Mr Lieberman pledged his commitment to ""responsible, reasonable policy"".
The deal led Moshe Yaalon, a member of Mr Netanyahu's Likud party, to quit as defence minister in protest on Friday.
The former general warned that Israel was being taken over by ""dangerous and extreme elements"".
Mr Lieberman, who has twice served as foreign minister, has a reputation for inflammatory comments and takes a hawkish stance towards the Palestinians.
Avigdor Lieberman is a colourful addition to Israel's ruling coalition.
A Russian-speaking immigrant from the former Soviet Union, he is routinely described in newspaper profiles as a former nightclub bouncer in reference to a brief chapter in his early life.
Mr Lieberman served as foreign minister in the past, where he was generally perceived to cut a sometimes undiplomatic figure. At the defence ministry he will be in charge of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), one of the most revered institutions in Israeli society. Benjamin Netanyahu has emphasised, though, that he will continue to take the lead in matters of national security.
The recruitment of Mr Lieberman and his Yisrael Beitenu party cannot be seen straightforwardly as a sign of a government drifting to the right.
Mr Netanyahu has been desperate to find a way to enlarge his coalition, which previously had a majority of a single vote, and he considered cutting a deal with the left-wing opposition before finally turning to Mr Lieberman.
Profile: Avigdor Lieberman
Since winning a fourth term in office last year, Mr Netanyahu has said he would explore bringing a sixth party into his coalition to widen its majority in parliament.
Wednesday's deal will give the prime minister control of 67 of the 120 seats in the Knesset. He previously had 61, which made it difficult to pass legislation.
Before agreeing to bring in Yisrael Beitenu, Mr Netanyahu had engaged in negotiations with the centre-left Zionist Union, amid international pressure to resume peace talks with the Palestinians.
France recently announced it would host an international conference on 3 June to try to revive the peace process, which collapsed amid acrimony in 2014.
""I am committed to promoting the peace process. I am committed to make every effort to reach an agreement,"" Mr Netanyahu said after signing the coalition deal with Mr Lieberman in Jerusalem.
""I intend to seize those opportunities. A broader government, a more stable government will make it easier to do so,"" he added.
Mr Lieberman, who lives in a Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank, has repeatedly voiced scepticism about pursuing peace with the Palestinians.
At one point he suggested toppling the Palestinian Authority. A few weeks ago he threatened to kill a Hamas leader if the militant Islamist movement did not return the bodies of Israeli soldiers killed in the 2014 war in the Gaza Strip.
But on Wednesday he stated: ""My commitment first of all is to responsible, reasonable policy.""
""All of us have commitments to peace, to the final status agreement, to understanding between us and our neighbours.""
The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, warned that Mr Lieberman's appointment as defence minister would ""result in apartheid, racism and religious and political extremism"".
In a separate development on Wednesday, an Israeli human rights group said it would stop filing complaints against alleged abuses by Israeli soldiers.
B'Tselem said that after 25 years of going through the military's legal channels it had concluded the process was what it called a ""whitewash mechanism"".
The military said B'Tselem's view was biased and failed to reflect reality.","The document discusses a deal between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Avigdor Lieberman, which will see Lieberman appointed as the new defence minister.

49,"Sgt Conchita Lopez, 28, is one of 10 policewomen in the border town of Tapachula in Mexico's southern Chiapas state. For six years she has been a member of the Mexican State Border Police.
Tapachula lies 32km (20 miles) from the border with Guatemala and is an entry point for many migrants fleeing violence and poverty in Central America.
Sgt Lopez has five sisters and five brothers, one of whom is in the Marines. ""I kept trying to get in, but there was never a space for me so I did private security for a while and then joined the police,"" she explains her career choice.  She is the only female member of her family to join the force.
As the sergeant in charge of the patrol she has to prepare all of her kit before setting off. ""I'm part of a police unit that looks after the rights of migrants crossing the border,"" explains Sgt Lopez about her role on border with Guatemala.
Sgt Lopez spends much of her time on patrol in the streets of Tapachula. ""We have many hotels and shelters here which house migrants from places such as El Salvador and Honduras,"" she says.
""We used to have a little place in the square for women who had been trafficked. It's a very common problem in Tapachula. It was a place for them to get legal advice and support, but it closed down. I would really like to do more to help them. At the moment I do a talk in a drop-in centre at the border to warn women about the tactics men use to trick them.""
Although her family lives in the same town, Sgt Lopez has to stay and sleep in the police station for four weeks at a time while on duty.
All the food in the station is prepared by the police officers. They work, live and eat together for the duration of their four-week long shift.
As Sgt Lopez carries on with her patrol, she comes across a young family living in an old railway carriage. The family is from Yucatan in Mexico and are visiting family in Tapachula. They live in the empty carriage because they cannot afford a hotel.
The border between Mexico and Guatemala is a popular crossing point for migrants trying to reach the Unites States. They come from El Salvador, Honduras, Venezuela and some from countries further afield such as Cameroon, Ethiopia and Eritrea.
As Sgt Lopez approaches the river's edge a man carrying a heavy load turns and walks back to the Guatemalan side of the river.
""Some people are afraid of the police. We know that there are bad police officers who often extort money from people bringing goods across the river,"" says Sgt Lopez.
""There used to be a checkpoint nearby so they take this path to avoid it. It's where women have had their goods stolen so we regularly check it.""
Migrants often follow the rail tracks to try and avoid checkpoints along the route.
""It's really hard for migrants as they come to escape from violence and often when they get here they experience the same thing.""
""On my five days off I just get straight into my own clothes and visit my boyfriend. He's cool with me being a police woman."" On her Sundays off Sgt Lopez plays football for the Tapachula women's team.
""I get to be out there helping people,"" says Sgt Lopez. ""I want to help people. I like to deal with the bad guys.""","Sgt Conchita Lopez is a 28-year-old member of the Mexican State Border Police in Tapachula, Mexico.
