Tonight, we have Mr. Steven Kayne, who has just taken over and established bicycle shop. Tell us, Mr. Kayne, what made you want to run yourown store?\n#Person2#: Well, I always loved racing bikes and fixing them. When I was working full-time as a salesman for a big company, I seldom had time to enjoy my hobby. I knew then that as soon as I had enough money to get my own business going, I'll do it. I had my heart set on it and I didn't let anything stand in my way. When I went down to the bank and got a business loan, I knew I'd love being myown boss. Now my time is my own. I open the store when I want and leave when I want.\n#Person1#: You mean you don't keep regular hours?\n#Person2#: Well, the sign on my store says the hours are ten to six, but if business isslower than usual, I can just lock up and take off early.\n#Person1#: Have you hired any employees to work with you yet?\n#Person2#: Yeah, a couple of friends of mine who love biking as much as I do. They help me out a few days a week. It's great because we play cards or just sit around and talk when there are no customers.\n#Person1#: Thank you, Mr. Kayne.

We understand that there were also minicab drivers parked in the area who may have seen something as well.\n#Person1#: As it is, I take it you haven't been able to identify them.\n#Person2#: No, not at this stage.\n#Person1#: Well, thank you very much.",

I don't know the proper settings for the rest of the machines.\n#Person2#: We can just go through them next time. It's no problem. Really. The most important thing is to know your limits.

What kind of music do you like listening to?\n#Person2#: I like many kinds of music. Sometimes I listen to the music that has fast beat and is lively, like dance music. You know, I go to a disco almost every week. Sometimes it's too loud though. And I love classical music the most. I find it very relaxing. I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work.\n#Person1#: How do you know about classical music?\n#Person1#: Actually, I specialized in classical music for my master study. Classical music is supposed to be good for you brain. Researches suggest that it makes your brain more active. Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better. That's true. There's clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people. Music can influence a person's feeling and character.\n#Person2#: Good, I am pretty satisfied with your background. Do you think students should listen to more classical music than others and why?\n#Person1#: Yes. Sometimes students can be stressful. Listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress. That's why I listen to it in the evenings. I usually play it as background music while I'm cooking or doing other housework.\n#Person2#: Okay, I think I've known enough of you. The interview is over.\n#Person1#: Thank you for your time.\n#Person2#: Oh, by the way. I think I may want to listen to some classical music. Do you have any suggestions?\n#Person1#: You can find plenty of recording on the internet. You can search and listen to different classical music and see which interests you the most. You can also buy them very cheaply online if you like them.\n#Person2#: That's a good idea. I'll try it.",

But do you mean the province of Quebec or Quebec City?\n#Person1#: I mean the province. My friend's wedding is in Montreal, so I'm going there first. I'll stay for 5 days. Is Montreal the capital city of the province?\n#Person2#: Well, many people think so because it's the biggest city, but it's not the capital. Quebec City is, but Montreal is great. The Santa Lawrence River runs right through the middle of the city. It's beautiful in summer.\n#Person1#: Wow, and do you think I can get by in English? My French is okay, but not that good. I know most people there speak French, but can I also use English?\n#Person2#: Well, people speak both French and English there, but you'll hear French most of the time and all the street signs are in French. In fact, Montreal is the third largest French-speaking city in the world. So you'd better practice your French before you go.\n#Person1#: Good advice, what about Quebec City? I'll visit a friend from college who lives there now. What's it like?\n#Person2#: It's a beautiful city, very old. Many old buildings have been nicely restored. Some of them were built in the 17th and 18th centuries. You'll love it there.\n#Person1#: Fantastic. I can't wait to go.",

We'd learned a lot about the environment in our science lessons, so I decided to see what I could do in my own life rather than just act completely helpless. And I knew the rest of my family would be interested.\n#Person1#: Did you find it easy to get information?\n#Person2#: Yeah, I discovered there were lots of people at my age trying to be green. I'd always gone to school by car. Catching a bus would be better, but there's no bus where we live. So I've gone for riding my bike to school now.\n#Person1#: OK. And what about being green once you're actually at school?\n#Person2#: Well, I realized that although all school paper was recycled and most of my friends use both sides of paper. We use huge quantities and I thought we should cut down and then it came to me that we should be sending in most of our work electronically. I'm going to recommend it to our teachers.\n#Person1#: And what about the school cafeteria?\n#Person2#: One school I've read about has meatless Mondays. It's good to use local produce, too.

I have heard the police will be standing by with tear gas.\n#Person1#: Yes, but North Korea boasts it has nuclear arms.\n#Person2#: One hundred ninety countries have signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty but the issues are just too complex. There are two sides to every story. I don't understand it and I have no intention of going to a demonstration. Demonstrations don't seem to accomplish anything anyway.\n#Person1#: Several demonstrations have changed politician's minds throughout history. As a responsible citizen I think it is important to stand up for what you believe in.\n#Person2#: Leave it to someone else. As I said, if you listen to both sides of a story, both sides have some good points. Why should I demonstrate and risk getting hurt for something that I am not even sure is right?\n#Person1#: You are not likely to get hurt. This will be a peaceful demonstration. I have spoken to the organizer for the university group. He insists that this will be peaceful. He advocates if you want world peace, peace begins at home-and that means right here in this city.\n#Person2#: You go if you want, Simon, but I plan to study for my physics exam.\n#Person1#: It would only take two hours of your day. The bus leaves the campus at 11:30 and leaves downtown to return to campus at 12:45. You could eat your lunch on the bus.\n#Person2#: I am not going, Simon. Why don't you ask the students in your political science class this afternoon if they want to go?\n#Person1#: They are all going.\n#Person2#: Okay, Simon. I need to meet my sister for coffee now.\n#Person1#: Bye then. See you in physics class tomorrow.",
