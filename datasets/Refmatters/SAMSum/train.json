Especially you I mean.\r\nMell: I don't know. Sometimes I even forget that I should be missing them. In a way I do like this peace and quiet now.\r\nGloria: Small wonder. You had a hell of a time with them just before they went to college. I'd say you need to recover now.\r\nMell: I guess you're right. But maybe I should feel guilty or something?\r\nGloria: Don't be silly! You are a fantastic mom.\r\nMell: Thanks Gloria.\r\nGloria: Anyway I'm happy to hear from you again. We should really have a nice do again.\r\nMell: YES! Splendid!\r\nGloria: The weather is just brilliant, perfect for a BBQ. What do you think?\r\nMell: I'm all for it. At my place? I'd love it.\r\nGloria: Can't be better. I love your garden.\r\nMell: We're thinking about extending the terrace. I must show you my drawings, just a few ideas. It would be great to hear your opinion.\r\nGloria: I'd love to. But you know how little I know about garden design, or however you call it.\r\nMell: We'll have a look at them. Now the BBQ. At the weekend I suppose?\r\nGloria: Let me check the calendar. Here's our family planner. A horrible name, isn't it? So this weekend suits us fine. At the next one, on Saturday, Mark has penciled something in but I can't read it. So what about this Saturday?\r\nMell: Perfect. At least we know the weather holds. Shall I do the food and you the drinks?\r\nGloria: And I'll get us some dessert as well. \r\nMell: Very good indeed. It's always so easy going with you.\r\nGloria: Ta! You were thinking about Tad's sister?\r\nMell: I'm afraid so. I'm so happy she moved up to Scotland and I don't have to put up with her trying to run my household. Tad feels relieved too.\r\nGloria: Good riddance! I could really never warm up to her.\r\nMell: Nobody can! Anyway she's gone and we're going to have a fantastic barbecue. Without her.\r\nGloria: Yes, we are. Oh I'm so happy you've phoned!\r\nMell: Looking forward to our BBQ on Saturday!\r\nGloria: So long!",

So are you looking for two bed now?\r\nRob: Three bed would be perfect so that we won't have to move out again when we decide to have another baby. \r\nKate: That's sounds reasonable.\r\nRob: I know. It just the prices.. total madness!!!\r\nKate: I can only imagine. It's getting more expensive year after year. \r\nRob: I've got a friend who's relocating to another city so want to sell his flat ASAP and offers a good price. We're seeing him tomorrow. \r\nKate: Good luck with that! ;)\r\nRob: Fingers crossed! ;)",

I should try and read one of his novels in the original, but I'm not sure my level of Italian is adequate.\r\nStefano: The Name of the Rose is really difficult for a foreign speaker of Italian, you know.\r\nJosie: And what about Foucault's Pendulum?\r\nStefano: Well, it's set in the 1980s, so the language is definitely more comprehensible. The content, however, is just as complicated as in the other novel.\r\nJosie: Btw, I read Salman Rushdie's review of Pendulum, published in the 80s.\r\nStefano: Really? What did he say?\r\nJosie: He hated it and said that it's not a novel, but rather a computer game.\r\nStefano: What? Rotfl!\r\nJosie: That's what Salman said...\r\nStefano: Oh well, de gustipus non est disputandum...\r\nJosie: De gustiBus!\r\nStefano: I know, it was a typo!\r\nJosie: Disgusting pus!\r\nStefano: Hahaha.\r\nJosie: Yuk!

What about general awareness? Plastic bags, etc.?\r\nRonnie: Very high. No more single use plastic bags in grocery stores. No more straws in restaurants.\r\nClint: Yeah, I read yours was one of the cities that banned them. I wonder when that will get here.\r\nRonnie: Never...\r\nClint:: What do you mean?\r\nRonnie: I highly doubt that type of environmental awareness will happen there. People there live in a different world when it comes to that.\r\nClint: People don't have to have any awareness, tbh. It's above them. If there were such decisions made they would follow\r\nRonnie: That is true. But at the state government level I don't think there is that awareness either. But hopefully I am proven wrong!\r\nClint: Really bizarre. I noticed it's struggling here. On the other hand, it's money.\r\nRonnie: Money in the sense of?\r\nClint: Reducing waste=lower utilization costs.

Obviously it's up to you, you are doing the music. Not every musician likes to jst perform with people he doesn't know.\r\nFreddy: It wasn't my idea, but if you are ok with we can do it.\r\nSimon: The only problem I have is that I can't see myself finding any free time in the coming week to practice and the concert is on Friday. Do you have backing tracks for the things you like to sing?\r\nFreddy: Sure, I can send you something.\r\nSimon: How many would you like to sing? \r\nFreddy: I don't know, one or two, three at most.\r\nSimon: OK, then send me three tracks. Maybe it'll be possible for me to play guitar as you sing for one or two of the tracks, we'll have to see. \r\nFreddy: That would be good. In the end live music is something a lot more special than just using backing tracks.\r\nSimon: I'll send you my email address and you can send me the attachments on that.\r\nFreddy: Will do. thanks.",

Kira could help you in the hols.\r\nBeth: Maybe, but I'd like to try working. I'm 16 soon, I'm old enough.\r\nDeirdre: I know. Look, pop in tomorrow after school and we'll have a cuppa and a chat.\r\nBeth: Yes, thanks auntie. I'd really like to try the beauty therapy side.\r\nDeirdre: Its not for the squeamish, mind. Massage, pedicures, not to mention waxing!\r\nBeth: Oh yes, I was chatting to a friend about it yesterday!\r\nDeirdre: Maxine manages the beauty side, you can meet her tomorrow and we'll see how it goes.\r\nBeth: Yes, I'd really like that. \r\nDeirdre: We can try a few hours on a Saturday for a couple of weeks as work experience. I'll give you a tenner or so per session to start off for your lunch, coffee and bus fare etc. If you like, we'll take it from there.\r\nBeth: OK, I like the sound of it! See you tomorrow Auntie!

Good money and no rat race.\r\nRael: Zach, are you crazy? I don't have technical studies.\r\nZach: You don't have to. If you have good analytical skills all you need is some online course - Udemy or something. People change their career after years of employment in totally different business. It's not that difficult, really. You should give it a try. Tech is our future.\r\nRael: Hmm... Maybe you're right. I'm still not sure what to do with my career, so... why not.\r\nZach: If you want, I can talk to my friends and they will give you some advice on how to start, what courses to choose and so on.\r\nRael: That would be great, thanks.\r\nZach: UW.

One downstairs, one upstairs.\r\nBez: Please don't forget to give the plants in the basement an occasional drink! Thank you.\r\nBez: I'm home on the 21st in the evening.
