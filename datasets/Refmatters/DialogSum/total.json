This number here represents your gross pay. Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that.

It's a terrible place full of excellent profiteers! You have to keep an eye whenever it comes to paying for something.\n#Person2#: cool down, Harry! What are you really mad about? Did you get ripped off?\n#Person1#: yes. Last Sunday I went to a nearby market. It was on open-air fair. I chanced upon this bag and bought it on the spot, without even trying to strike a bargain. I paid one hundred and twenty. And just now I was told by my Chinese colleagues I bought it overpriced. I could have talked my way to thirty.\n#Person2#: is that so? I'm afraid people here will not take pity on unlucky guys like you. Bargaining has always been an indispensable procedure in business deals. It's the norm of free trade. The seller sets a preposterous price, and the buyer tries his best to bring it down, until a compromise is reached. Yet you ignored the process. No wonder you ended up easy prey.\n#Person1#: but don't you think it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin?\n#Person2#: of course, that's something really irritating. And the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff. I recommend you to consult the price tags in the supermarket first. And then you may negotiate for a fair deal.", "references": ["Harry tells #Person2# that the bag was overpriced in a street market. #Person2# suggests that Harry should bargain with the seller and consult the price tags in the supermarket first.", "#Person2# suggests Harry consult the price tags in the supermarket first and then negotiate for a fair deal after Harry bought a bag overpriced and got a terrible feeling.", "Harry is mad because he bought a bag overpriced at a street market in China. #Person2# says it's common and people should know the real worth and then negotiate for a fair deal."], "model_summaries": {"BART": {"original_summary": "Harry tells #Person2# he got ripped off because he didn't strike a bargain. #Person1# thinks it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin.", "consistency": true, "modified": "Harry tells #Person2# he got ripped off because he didn't strike a bargain. #Person1# thinks it annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin.", "error_categories": []}, "UniLM": {"original_summary": "harry complains to person2 that he got ripped off at a street market because he bought a bag overpriced last sunday . person2 thinks people will not take pity on him . person2 advises harry to consult the price tags first and negotiate for a fair deal .", "consistency": true, "modified": "harry complains to person2 that he got ripped off at a street market because he bought a bag overpriced last sunday . person2 thinks people will not take pity on him . person2 advises harry to consult the price tags first and negotiate for a fair deal .", "error_categories": []}, "MV-BART": {"original_summary": "Harry complains to #Person2# that he got ripped off in a street market in China because he bought a bag on the spot without bargaining and was told by his Chinese colleagues that he bought it overpriced. #Person1# thinks it's annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin and advises him to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff.", "consistency": false, "modified": "Harry complains to #Person2# that he got ripped off in a street market in China because he bought a bag on the spot without bargaining and was told by his Chinese colleagues that he bought it overpriced. #Person1# thinks it's annoying to overcharge the customers by such a handsome margin.
