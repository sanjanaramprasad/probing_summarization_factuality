So no Game of Thrones :)\r\nJoe: Or alternatively you can chose some cooperative games - like Arkham Horror, Robinson Crusoe, Pandemic\r\nTim: Got it :D \r\nJoe: Also would be great to know what theme they all like - if there is one. And if not then there are some 'vanilla' games - like Codenames or Catan. Any idea what they might be into? \r\nTim: Not really - there are some guys who I know like sci-fi and comic books, but no idea about the girls... \r\nJoe: The best way - just talk with them - might be surprised by their tastes and experiences. Maybe some of them are already into gaming? There are nerds in every walk of life :)\r\nTim: Yeah, I know, all too well :)\r\nTim: Anyway, thanks for the tips - co-op games sound like a good idea for a start.\r\nJoe: yeah, and then if the idea sticks you can roll out the big guns :)\r\nTim: Will do that :)",
